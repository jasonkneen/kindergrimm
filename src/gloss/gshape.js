// THE HAND — `sketch.js` draws, `carve.js` carves, this one CUTS AND
// STAMPS. Everything in this lab is solid geometry: no fields, no
// sampling grid, nothing to resolve. Two things get made here.
//
//   A SOLID — the body. A sphere, scaled.
//   A PLATE — every face feature. An outline, extruded, bevelled.
//
// The plate is the whole face system, and it is one shape of thing on
// purpose: a flat front with a rounded rim. That rim is the cartoon
// read — it is what catches the studio highlight around the edge of an
// eye, and it is why a feature looks moulded into the character rather than
// printed on it.
//
// AUTHORING RULE: a plate's front crest sits at z = 0 and its body
// runs BACKWARD. Placed on the skin it is therefore flush, and `proud`
// is the single number that lifts it out. Because the body runs
// backward and the sphere curves away underneath, a plate can never
// float off the silhouette.
//
// Parts never import this file — they never touch three.js. They name
// an OUTLINE and hand over numbers, and the rig stamps them here.

// one of it, and it is four hundred pixels across: every segment is
// worth having. In `marbles.html` there are a dozen on a table at
// sixty pixels each, and at full detail one of them was a quarter of a
// million vertices and twenty-eight milliseconds to build — which is
// half a frame's budget, per marble, for a resolution that lands
// entirely between two pixels.
//
// It is a SCALE rather than a set of alternative numbers, so the lab's
// proportions survive it, and every count keeps a floor: a body below
// about fourteen segments stops being round, and a bevel below two
// stops being a bevel, which is the whole cartoon read.
