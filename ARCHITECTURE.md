# drawai — architecture, and how to add a part

Read this before touching the code. It is written so that adding a new
kind of part is a **small, local, mechanical** change: one new file,
one line in a registry, nothing else.

---

## 1. The one-paragraph version

A character is a **recipe** (plain JSON). The **rig** asks each
**part** to generate its params — biased by the **species** profile —
then hands everything to the **layout**, which computes every shared
measurement once. Each part is then asked what bones it wants and
draws itself onto a small canvas per bone. Those canvases become
textures on flat planes hanging off `THREE.Group` bones, which the
**animator** moves. Drawing is done by the **hand** (`sketch.js`)
through a **medium** (`media.js`), so every part looks like it was
made by the same person with the same pencil.

```
                 species.js  (loads the dice)
                      │
recipe ──► gen() ─────┴──► params ──► layout.js ──► F (shared geometry,
                                                       colours, medium)
                                          │
                  parts/index.js ─────────┼──► bones(P,F) ──► canvas per bone
                                          │    draw(s,P,st,F,bone)
                                          ▼
                                       rig.js ──► bones ──► anim.js
```

**Three levers, deliberately independent:**

| Lever | Answers | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **species** | *what animal is it* | `species.js` — biases generation only |
| **media** | *what is it made of* | `media.js` — graphite, oil, watercolour… |
| **params** | *which individual is it* | the recipe itself |

## 2. Files

| File | What lives there | Touch it when… |
|---|---|---|
| `src/sketch.js` | **The hand.** Strokes, fills, hatching, washes, oil daubs, geometry helpers. | you need a new *drawing technique* |
| `src/media.js` | **The material.** graphite/ink/watercolour/oil/chalk/marker; each answers `tone`/`skin`/`edge`. | you add a new medium |
| `src/species.js` | **The casting.** One table of loaded dice per species. | you add a species ← *data only* |
| `src/layout.js` | **The skeleton.** Every shared measurement: head outline, eye anchors, body block `B`. | two parts must agree on a position |
| `src/parts/*.js` | **The parts.** One file per feature family. | you add a part or a variant ← *usually this* |
| `src/parts/index.js` | **The registry.** The ordered list of active parts. | you add a part file |
| `src/rig.js` | recipe → bones → meshes. Generic; knows nothing about eyes or arms. | almost never |
| `src/anim.js` | **The animator core.** Autonomic life (boil, blink, gaze, talk, sway, breath), pose blending, expression crossfades. | you change how blending works |
| `src/poses/*.js` | **The poses.** idle, walk, run, sit, sleep, attack — one file each. | you add a pose ← *like adding a part* |
| `src/expressions.js` | **The expressions.** idle, angry, scared, crying, sleeping. | you add an expression |
| `src/part.js` | canvas/texture plumbing (`makePart`), render resolution. | almost never |
| `src/ground.js` | the game room's floor tiles + the blob shadows | the room's look |
| `src/scenery.js` | the props in the room (toys, cots, the nightlight) | you add furniture |
| `src/dark.js` | **global illumination** — the room is black outside the lamps | how light behaves |
| `src/postfx.js` | tilt-shift, vignette — the *lens* | the mood of the whole frame |
| `src/items/core.js` | **the object hand.** `REF`, the rank ladder, `finish()`, `stamp()`, the stat algebra | you change how objects are drawn or costed |
| `src/items/*.js` | **the item families.** One file per family of object. | you add an object ← *data + one drawing* |
| `src/items/index.js` | the item registry, the roll, and favour | you add a family file |
| `src/parts/gear.js` | `Held` / `Offhand` / `Worn` — items on a body | almost never |
| `src/main.js` / `src/crowd.js` / `src/game.js` | the three scenes | new scene features |
| `src/voxel/*` | **the voxel generator** — a second, parallel rig that builds solids instead of drawings. Same recipe idea, its own hand, layout, parts and animator. | see §11 |

## 3. Coordinates and units — the thing to get right

There are exactly two:

**Character coordinates** — what `draw()` uses. Pixels, **y points
DOWN**, origin at the **centre of the head**. The body is at positive
y. `F.s` is the head scale in px and almost every number should be
written as a multiple of it (`F.s * .3`), never as a raw pixel count,
so characters stay consistent at any size.

**World units** — what `bones()` and `size()` use. This is
`pixels / U`. Always divide by `U`:

```js
bones: (P, F) => [{ name: 'thing', x: F.B.hipX / U, y: -F.B.hipY / U }],
```

Note the **minus** on y: bone space is normal 3D (y up), drawing space
is canvas (y down). A part that sits below the head has a *negative*
bone y and draws at *positive* y.

`U` is resolution only. The crowd lowers it to draw 35 characters
cheaply; layout is unaffected because everything is a ratio.

---

## 4. The part contract

A part is a plain object. Only `id`, `label`, `order`, `gen`, `bones`,
`size` and `draw` are required.

```js
export const MyPart = {
  id: 'myPart',          // unique; also the key inside recipe.parts
  label: 'mi parte',     // shown in the editor (Spanish)
  order: 3,              // draw order: higher is drawn IN FRONT
  depth: 1,              // parallax: how much it rides when the head moves
                         //   1 = a front feature, 0 = the skull, <0 = behind
  region: 'head',        // 'head' (default) moves with sway/gaze/breath;
                         //   'body' stays PLANTED on the floor
  species: ['nightmare'],// optional: this part EXISTS only for these
                         //   species. Omit and everyone can have it.
  pivot: [.5, .5],       // optional: where the bone sits on the canvas
                         //   [.5,1] = top edge (part hangs downward)
  states: ['idle'],      // optional: extra pre-drawn textures (see §6)

  // Params from a seeded rng — this is what makes one character
  // differ from another. Keep every value a plain number/string/bool
  // so the recipe stays JSON.
  //
  // C is the CASTING helper (§9): ask it for anything a species might
  // want an opinion about, and it falls back to your default when the
  // species is silent. Use the plain rng for the rest.
  gen: (rng, C) => ({
    style: C.pick(rng, 'style', [['a', 60], ['b', 40]]),  // weighted list
    size:  C.range(rng, 'size', .5, 1.5),                 // a number
    on:    C.chance(rng, 'on', .4),                       // a yes/no
    jitter: rng.r(-.1, .1),                               // nobody's business
  }),

  // editor controls, one entry per param you want to expose
  meta: () => ({
    style: { label: 'estilo', pick: ['a', 'b'] },
    size:  { label: 'size', range: [.3, 2] },          // add step:1 for ints
    on:    { label: 'visible', bool: true },
  }),

  skip: (P, F) => P.style === 'none',   // optional: draw nothing

  // one entry per canvas. Two entries = a mirrored pair.
  bones: (P, F) => [-1, 1].map(sd => ({
    name: 'my' + (sd < 0 ? 'L' : 'R'),
    x: sd * F.w * .5 / U,
    y: -F.s * .2 / U,
    side: sd,            // handed to draw() as bone.side
    // order / depth can be overridden here per bone
  })),

  // canvas size in WORLD units. Must cover everything you draw or it
  // gets clipped. Too big is only a memory cost.
  size: (P, F) => [(F.w * 1.5) / U, (F.s * 1.2) / U],

  // s = Sketch, P = params, st = current state, F = layout, bone = the
  // bone entry from bones(). Draw in CHARACTER coordinates.
  draw(s, P, st, F, bone) {
    const sd = bone.side;
    const shape = s.blobPts(sd * F.w * .5, F.s * .2, F.s * .1, F.s * .1, 0, .45);
    F.media.tone(s, shape, { style: 'light', gap: F.s * .05 });
    F.media.edge(s, shape.concat([shape[0]]), F.lwThin * 1.2, {});
  },
};
```

Then register it in `src/parts/index.js`, in draw order. That is the
whole job — the editor panel, the recipe, reroll/lock and the crowd
all pick it up automatically.

---

## 5. Rules that keep it looking like one drawing

1. **Never call a technique directly.** Use `F.media.tone(...)` for a
   mass, `F.media.skin(...)` for skin colour, `F.media.edge(...)` for a
   contour. If you call `s.pencilFill` yourself, your part stays
   graphite while the rest of the character is watercolour.
   Fine detail lines (`s.sline`, `s.stroke`) are exempt — they are the
   underdrawing. Guard heavy pencil shading with
   `if (F.media.underdraw)`, which is false for oil.
2. **Size everything from `F.s`** (head scale) or `F.w` / `F.B.*`.
   No raw pixel constants.
3. **Weights:** `F.lwMain` for a silhouette, `F.lwThin` for detail.
4. **`s.blobPts` spins its ellipse freely.** For anything not roughly
   circular pass a small explicit rotation, or it will stand on end and
   slash across the character: `s.blobPts(x, y, rx, ry, s.jr(-.2,.2))`.
   Its 6th argument is wobble: `1` is a scribbled mass, `~.4` is a
   shape drawn slowly and carefully (eyes use this).
5. **Randomness inside `draw()` is the boil.** It is re-rolled every
   redraw, so anything decided there *shimmers*. Decisions that must
   hold still (which style, how long, which side) belong in `gen()`.
6. **Positions two parts share go in `layout.js`**, not in both parts.

---

## 6. States (how animation works)

`states: ['idle']` by default. Every state is drawn into its own
texture, so animating is a texture swap — free at runtime. States are
drawn **lazily**: only the resting state is paid for at build time,
and an expression nobody makes never costs a canvas.

- Eyes declare the autonomic set (`open/closed` + four glances) plus
  the expression set (`angry/scared/cry`): blinking, glancing and
  emoting are all swaps.
- Mouth declares `['idle','open']` for talk plus
  `['angry','scared','cry','sleep']` for the expressions.
- Brows declare `['idle','angry','sad','raised']`; QuadLegs declare
  `['idle','stepA','stepB','fold']` — the four-legged walk is a
  flip-book of diagonal pairs, and 'fold' is the sphinx sleep.
- `draw()` receives the state as `st` and decides what changes.

The animator also moves bones (`e.bone.position/rotation/scale`) —
that is how sway, breath, arm swing and the gaze parallax work. Bones
remember their rest position in `bone.userData.base`.

The rig splits bones into `headGroup` and `bodyGroup` by each part's
`region`. All head motion (sway, the gaze head-cock, the breath lift)
is applied to `headGroup` only; the body stays planted so the feet
never leave the floor. Body parts get their life explicitly (the torso
swells with the breath, the arms swing) — if you add a body part and
want it to move, add its behaviour to `anim.js`, don't give it
`region:'head'`.

**The floor:** `F.B.floorY` is how far (in px) the character's feet
hang below the head centre, whatever its proportions. Scenes stand a
character on a drawn line with
`group.position.y = floorLineY + F.B.floorY / U`. If your part extends
below the feet, extend `bodyLayout()` so `floorY` still tells the
truth.

### Poses and expressions

On top of the autonomic life sit two crossfaded systems:

**Poses** (`src/poses/`, registry in `src/poses/index.js`) say what
the body is doing: idle, walk, run, sit, sleep, attack. A pose writes
bone/group *offsets* through a small ctx API, and every write is
scaled by the pose's blend weight — a transition is two poses mixing,
so nothing snaps. Walk and run share ONE gait phase, so a tempo change
never teleports a foot. One-shots (attack) play out and hand back.
Poses scale the autonomic layers through `auto` multipliers (sleep:
gaze 0, breath 2.2) instead of switching them off. The full contract
is documented at the top of `src/poses/index.js`; every pose handles
the three bases (`biped`/`sit`/`quad`).

**Expressions** (`src/expressions.js`) say what the face is doing:
idle, angry, scared, crying, sleeping. An expression = texture states
per face part + continuous body language on the same weight API.
Texture swaps are binary, so the animator lands them *while a blink
has the eyes shut*; the brows/shiver/sob ramp with the crossfade,
which is where the smoothness comes from.

Scenes drive both with `animator.setPose(id)` / `animator.setFace(id)`.

---

## 6b. The room (`game.html`) — Kindergrimm, and 3D

The game scene is a **real 3D world**, ported from the `draw-test`
prototype: a floor lying flat on XZ, an orthographic camera orbiting
above it, and every drawing standing on that floor as an upright
billboard. The editor and the crowd are still flat pages — only this
scene is 3D, which is why `addPaper()` (a camera-facing page plus a
paper-tooth quad) is **not** used here: under an orbiting camera those
go edge-on. The game gets its grain and vignette from DOM overlays in
`game.html` instead, and its lens from `postfx.js`.

```
billboard   holder.rotation.y = view.az     — yaw ONLY, never pitch.
            The drawing stays square to the page and simply eats the
            foreshortening. That is the whole Don't-Starve trick.
mirror      screen-space, never world-space:
              mdot = cos(h)*view.rightX + sin(h)*view.rightZ
            latch the flip only when |mdot| > .15, then lerp scale.x
            through zero so the turn reads as a paper flip. A
            world-space flip moonwalks the moment the camera orbits
            past 90°. Safe only because parts are DoubleSide planes.
depth key   x*sin(az) + z*cos(az) — the view-axis projection. Under an
            ORTHO camera radial distance is the wrong key and inverts
            characters at opposite frame edges.
shadow      its own scene object, never a child of the holder, or it
            inherits the yaw, the mirror and the breath.
            rotation.order = 'YXZ' so the yaw spins the ellipse WITHIN
            the floor instead of tipping it out of it.
floor       drawn TOP-DOWN and tiled, and the tiles STREAM: a fixed
            grid that follows the view, each cell showing the variant
            (and quarter-turn) its coordinate hashes to, so the floor
            is endless for a constant cost and never bakes mid-play.
            Never paint perspective into it — a baked vanishing point
            swings around with the camera — and never draw a long
            straight line, because one that starts at a tile edge
            lines up with its neighbour's and the floor turns back
            into graph paper.
```

The one fact that makes all this cheap: **`anim.js` never writes
`face.group`** — only `headGroup`/`bodyGroup`. So world placement, the
billboard yaw and the mirror all live on a holder above it, and the
animator never has to know the world became 3D. Every screen-space
offset it writes (sway, gaze parallax, breath) stays correct at every
azimuth, because a billboard is permanently a front view.

**Depth sorting is not optional.** Every material is `transparent`
with `depthWrite: false`, so what you see is decided *entirely* by
draw order, and three sorts by `renderOrder` before it ever looks at
z. Part orders span -4 (tail) to 7 (a horned crest), so with the raw
numbers every character's torso draws before *any* character's head
and two overlapping characters interleave part by part — a far face
punches through a near back.

`setDepthRank(face, rank)` in `rig.js` fixes this by giving each
character a contiguous 16-slot block of the renderOrder line
(`+0` shadow, `+1…+12` parts, `+13…+15` props). Rank 0 is farthest.
**Ranks must be unique** — two characters sharing one fall back to
three's mesh-id tie-break and interleave silently, so always break the
depth sort on entity index. The scene re-stamps every frame; a rebuilt
character has `rank === null` and is re-stamped for free.

**Lazy states cut both ways.** They are right for the crowd (35
characters that mostly never emote) and wrong in the room, where the
first blink and first glance would draw canvases mid-play. `game.js`
prewarms the states it will actually reach for (`WARM`) during the
load pass and leaves the expressions lazy.

**Nothing may build during play.** A character costs ~20 ms. The class
fills on a time budget at boot, and the nightmare wave is *queued* at
dusk and built one per frame — building a whole wave in one frame
stutters at exactly the moment the night is meant to feel dangerous.

### Camera and gestures — the game is played on a phone

The camera orbits a **pan target** (`camWant`, eased into `camAt`), not
the origin. Panning **grabs the floor**: remember the world point under
the finger and move the target so that point stays under it. Never
convert pixels to world units by hand — the foreshortening term is easy
to get subtly wrong and reads as drift. There is no pan clamp any more
— the floor has no edge to drag into shot — so what stops you getting
lost is `keepInFrame()`, which fetches the camera back only once the
class is *entirely* out of frame. A leash that pulled sooner would
fight a player looking ahead into the dark, which is the one thing
this game most wants them to do.

**Both rays must be cast in the same frame, and the target set
absolutely.** The camera *eases* toward `camWant`, so it is always a
little behind it. Ray the floor once at the finger's current pixel and
add the difference to `camWant` and you have measured the gap against
a camera that has not caught up yet — every move re-pays a debt
already owed, so a steady finger accelerates the pan and on release it
sails past and settles back. Ray the **start** pixel and the **current**
pixel with the camera as it is right now and the lag is in both rays
and cancels; then set `camWant` from the target the drag *started*
with, never `+=`. (Measured: one 6.2-unit drag became 7.5–15.7 units
depending only on how many `pointermove` events it took.) At the wall,
re-anchor the drag on the clamped value, or dragging back does nothing
until the finger has undone every pixel the clamp refused.

**On touch a tap and the start of a drag are the same event.** So every
press begins as a *provisional tap* and only becomes a pan once it has
travelled past `TAP_SLOP` or been held past `TAP_MS`. Orders are issued
on **release**, never on press — which is also what stops a pan from
dropping a lantern while the draft is waiting for a spot. Two pointers
cancel the tap outright and become pinch (zoom) plus twist (rotate,
behind a deadzone so a plain pinch does not spin the room).

Three things that bite:

- `setPointerCapture` **throws** if the pointer is already gone. Wrap
  it, or an exception loses the whole press.
- The canvas needs `touch-action: none` or the browser claims the
  gestures for scrolling, and the viewport needs `user-scalable=no` or
  a pinch zooms the *page*.
- **Tap targets do not scale with zoom.** Pick proxies are fixed world
  sizes, so zoomed out a child is a few pixels while a thumb is ~44 of
  them. `pickScale` grows the proxies with `halfH` to compensate.

Free twist is kept for desktop, but touch gets **quarter-turn buttons**
— an arbitrary angle is horrible to aim with two fingers and this room
has nothing that needs one.

### Global illumination (`src/dark.js`)

The room is **black**, everywhere the light does not reach — not
tinted, not dimmed. There is no day/night cycle; it is always dark,
and light is the only safe ground. That one decision is what makes a
lantern a decision instead of a decoration.

It is one plane lying on the floor whose fragment shader is handed
every live light in WORLD space. Each pixel asks how far it is from
the nearest lamp and paints itself black in proportion — a shadow mask
on the ground, one draw call, no render targets. The pool edge wobbles
on a slow clock, because a child drawing a circle of lamplight would
never get it round, and a clean radial gradient is the one thing here
that would look like a computer did it.

Billboards standing on the floor are **not** darkened by that plane —
they are drawn over it. `game.js` tints them on the CPU
(`mat.color.setScalar(v)`) from the same `lightAt()`, so what you see
and what the game thinks is lit can never disagree.

### The game

You start with three children on an endless dark floor: one carrying
a lamp, one a bat, one a sword, standing in the light of a single
lantern.

- **There is ONE verb.** Tap the floor and every child that is not
  fighting walks there (`state.goto`). That is the whole control
  scheme. There is **no selection and no character panel**: a child is
  only ever tapped while the draft is holding an object out, waiting
  to know who gets it. A panel would only restate in words what is
  already drawn on the child — what it carries is in its fists, and
  how it is doing is the red pulse and the mark over its head.
- **Light is not a weapon and not a shelter.** It does exactly one
  thing: you can *see*. It does not slow a nightmare (it used to mire
  them at 17%; that is gone), it does not hurt one, and standing in it
  costs and saves nothing. **A child cannot fight what it cannot see**
  — engagement requires `lightAt(mare) >= SEE` — so the lamps decide
  which of two games you are playing: in the light you stand and
  fight, in the dark you run.
- **A hand holds a lamp or a weapon, never both.** `Lamp` is a `held`
  family, so it competes with sword/bat/wand for the same slot. Its
  belly gives `lampR` *and* takes `dmg`/`swingT` — measured, a fat one
  leaves a child swinging at about 45% of an empty hand. That trade is
  the whole composition problem and it must never get cheap.
- **Every light in a draft is CARRIED.** The hand's light group is
  `kind: 'light'` minus `floor`, so it only ever deals a `Lamp`. A
  floor lantern is a *place*, and a place is worthless to a class that
  never stands still — it was dealt for a while and it was always the
  dead card. They still exist: `placeLantern()` scatters them out in
  the dark on a timer, rolled from the same `Lantern` family through
  `propDrawFor`, and you find one by walking toward a glow. On a floor
  with no landmarks that is the only thing that can pull a class
  anywhere, and unlike a lost child it needs no beacon because it *is*
  one.
- **Fighting roots you, but nobody fights alone.** A child with a lit
  nightmare in reach plants its feet and swings until one of them is
  finished; it will not walk away and you cannot call it off. A child
  with nothing in reach but a lit nightmare within `HELP_R` walks over
  and piles on — so one that arrives in the lamplight is swarmed by
  whoever is free, instead of duelling one child while the rest walk
  past. `HELP_R` is kept short so it reads as piling on and never as
  hunting. The group still tears itself in half at every crossing, and
  waiting for the stragglers *is* the game. A child that is not
  engaged can always be walked away from something it never saw —
  that is the mercy that makes the dark playable.
- **Nightmares hunt children** (`nearestKid`), not furniture. They do
  not bite: they **frighten**, `MARE_SCARE` energy per second while in
  contact, and a child at zero is collected by its parents. Nobody is
  ever hurt — this is a baby school, do not escalate it. The rule that
  a drain must be *visible* still stands, and this one is: a monster
  standing on the child, a red pulse, a mark over the head, a sound.
  Nothing else takes energy — there is no idle drain, the dark itself
  costs nothing, and a child left alone recovers (`REGEN`).
- **A child is three numbers**: **energy**, **attack**, **speed** —
  and those are exactly what the card shows. Everything else a stat
  bag carries (`reach`, `swingT`, `rest`, `lampR`, `scale`, `drain`,
  `knock`) is a modifier on how those three play out, not a fourth
  pillar. There is no morale system.
- **The floor has no edge** and no pan limit. Tiles are a fixed
  `GRID×GRID` block that follows the view, snapped to `TILE`, each
  showing the variant its coordinate hashes to (plus a quarter-turn
  from the same hash). So it is infinite, deterministic — walk away
  and back and the same scuffs are there — and a constant number of
  draw calls. **Nothing is baked during play**: the variants are drawn
  once at boot. The darkness plane follows the view too. What replaces
  `clampPan` is `keepInFrame`, which only fires once the class is
  entirely out of frame, plus the ⌾ button and `space`.
- **The camera rides the FLOCK** — `flockAt()`, the children who are
  actually walking. Whoever stopped to fight is deliberately left out:
  anchoring the frame to the one who stayed behind drags it backwards
  at exactly the moment you are deciding whether to leave them. A drag
  takes the camera back for `FOLLOW_HOLD` seconds so you can still
  look ahead into the dark, then it returns on its own.
- **You find the rest of the class in the dark.** `lost[]` children
  stand out there holding something, crying on a timer (a panned
  `squiggle`), with a question-mark mark that is the one thing visible
  through the black — it fades up as you close, so it is a direction
  and not an answer. Walk within `FIND_R` and they enlist. They are
  built ahead of time, one per frame, never in the same frame as a
  nightmare, and their kit is pre-seeded into the recipe so a found
  child costs ONE build and not two.
- **The class is meant to grow FAST** — four children by about level
  three, and up from there. `LOST_MIN`/`LOST_SPAN` is the whole dial:
  at 24-44 units a lost child was a two-way expedition that cost more
  than it brought, and at 11-23 it is a detour, which is what it
  should be. Several are out there at once (`LOST_MAX`) and the next
  is placed before you have reached the last.
- **Kills are the only economy.** `strike()` grants exactly 1 on a
  kill and nothing else fills the bar, so the number under it is *how
  many more nightmares*. The FIRST nightmare buys the first card
  (`xpNeed` starts at 1) — a player has to be shown what the bar is
  for before they can want it — and `XP_STEP` keeps them coming
  quickly after it. When it fills the world STOPS (`state.paused`
  zeroes `dt`, rendering continues) and a HAND of five generated
  objects is dealt — one lamp and four things to carry — of which you
  keep one, handing it to a child you then tap. There is no currency.
- **The tempo is spawn-gated, not fight-gated.** Measured: a class
  parked in the light kills a nightmare almost exactly as fast as one
  arrives, so `MARE_EVERY` *is* the pace of the whole game. Two
  numbers were badly wrong when this was first built and both were
  found by measuring, not by playing: nightmares at `.5` units/second
  from a spawn ring of 19 took **fifty seconds** to reach anybody, and
  a knockback of `2.6` threw them past a rooted child's reach so a
  fight was one hit every six seconds and nothing ever died.
- **The title screen** (`#start`, `state.started`) is also the load
  screen: the class is built one child per frame behind it, so the
  ~20 ms build cost lands while nobody is playing. `started` and
  `paused` are separate flags because they stop the world for opposite
  reasons — one holds a game that has not begun, the other freezes one
  in progress.
- **`frame()` and `pump()`** are the debug pair (`window.__game`). The
  loop is a named function so `pump(n)` can drive it by hand, because
  a hidden panel throttles rAF to a crawl and every measurement taken
  off one is a lie. It yields through a **MessageChannel**: a
  `setTimeout` is clamped to ~1s in a hidden tab, and a microtask
  never lets the event loop run at all, so the page hangs and nothing
  can read the result.

**Picking** is done with invisible proxy quads (`addPick`), one per
clickable entity, raycast in place of the real drawings: hit-testing
every part mesh of a child would be slow and would miss the gaps
between the strokes. Proxies must be *positioned* — characters get
theirs moved each frame, and a static thing needs its proxy placed at
creation or it sits at the origin, unclickable, while the origin
silently becomes clickable instead.

Objects that lie on the floor (beds) are `flat: true` — drawn
top-down, laid with `rotation.x = -π/2`, and placed UNDER the darkness
plane so the light shader paints them per-pixel like the floor.

**Every upright thing is a billboard** — props included, not just the
characters. `mesh.rotation.y = view.az` has to be re-applied to all of
them every frame; a prop that only gets a position is pinned to +Z and
goes edge-on the moment the camera orbits. They are **never mirrored**:
a doodle child does not turn around to walk the other way.

Bodies take up room: `separate()` pushes every overlapping pair of
characters apart along the line between them, half the correction
each, after everyone has moved.

## 7. Recipe

```json
{ "seed": 12345, "species": "dog", "media": "graphite", "color": "auto",
  "parts": { "eyes": { "params": { "type": "saucer" }, "lock": true, "rr": 2 } } }
```

Same JSON in, same character out, on any machine. `rr` re-rolls one
part; `lock` protects it from a global regenerate. This is the format a
game would ship.

---

## 8. Species — a casting profile, not code

A dog is **not** a new set of drawings. It is the same catalogue of
parts with the dice loaded toward floppy ears, a snout, spots and no
hair. So a species is a table of weights, in `src/species.js`:

```js
dog: {
  label: 'perro',
  cast: {
    crest:  { style: { floppy: 62, bear: 22, none: 16 } },
    nose:   { style: { snout: 74, button: 26 }, snoutLen: [1.15, 1.6] },
    extras: { spots: .55, tears: .04 },
  },
},
```

One table per part id. **The value's type says what it does:**

| You write | It means |
|---|---|
| `{ a: 60, b: 40 }` an object | weighted pick — and options you leave out **cannot happen** |
| `[1.1, 1.6]` an array | a number drawn from this range |
| `.55` a number | a probability |

Anything the profile does not mention keeps the part's own default, so
a profile states **only what makes that species different**.

**Species touches generation only.** Once params exist they are plain
numbers, so a saved recipe rebuilds identically even if the profile
changes or disappears — and you can still hand-edit any param
afterwards. That is why species lives beside the parts and not inside
them.

**The real job a species does is coherence.** Left to chance, floppy
ears, a snout and a wagging tail would almost never land on the same
character. Guaranteeing they arrive together is what a species *is*.

### But casting alone is not enough

Loading the dice gets you a human with animal accessories — *a kid in
a costume*. What actually makes a dog a dog is that **the head is a
different shape**, and a nightmare has parts a person simply does not. So a
species has three levers, in increasing cost:

| Lever | Cost | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **weights** — bias existing choices | free, data only | dogs get floppy ears and spots |
| **skull shape** — the head's own outline | one param + one branch | `muzzle` puts a snout in the silhouette |
| **its own part** — `species: ['nightmare']` | a new part file | wings; no dice roll turns an arm into one |

The rule of thumb: reach for a new part only when the shape could not
belong to anybody else. Wings qualify. A snout did not — it became a
param on the skull, so any species can have one.

**The muzzle is the worked example.** `skull.muzzle` does two things:
it swells the silhouette a little, and it tells `Skull.draw` to lay a
LOBE with its own contour over the jaw. A smooth bulge alone reads as
a long chin; the second outline is what reads as a snout. And because
`layout.js` publishes where that lobe landed (`F.L.M`), the nose and
the mouth sit **on** it — `F.L.noseY` and `F.L.my` already account for
it, so those parts never learn what a muzzle is.

### Bases — the skeleton, not the casting

`recipe.base` says what the character is built on: `biped` (the
big-headed two-legged doodle) or `sit` (an animal on its haunches with
its paws on the floor). The species picks one from its `bases` table.

A base changes two things and nothing else:

1. **`bodyLayout()` branches on it** and publishes different anchors —
   `sit` exports `frontPawX/Y`, `sidePawX/Y` and `pawR` where `biped`
   exports shoulders and hips. Both still publish `floorY`, so the
   floor code never learns a base exists.
2. **Parts declare `base: ['biped']` or `base: ['sit']`** and the rig
   skips the others. Arms and Legs are biped-only; `Paws` draws all
   four at once and is sit-only. Everything above the neck — every
   head, eye, ear, muzzle and medium — is shared untouched.

That is the whole mechanism, and it is the same one as `species`. A
quadruped standing on all fours would be a third base: a new branch in
`bodyLayout` and a `Legs4` part.

### Adding a species

1. Copy the nearest entry in `species.js` and change the tables.
2. If it needs a shape nobody has drawn yet (a beak, a tail), add that
   as a normal **variant of an existing part** first — see §9 — and
   then every species can use it.
3. Nothing else. Both scenes pick the new species up automatically.

### When a species needs a shape that varies

If a species wants a *family* of a shape rather than one drawing, give
that part params and let the profile set their range. The snout is the
worked example: `snoutLen`, `snoutFat`, `snoutTip` turn one drawing
into greyhound-to-bulldog, and then

```js
dog: { cast: { nose: { snoutLen: [1.15, 1.6] } } },   // long muzzles
cat: { cast: { nose: { snoutLen: [.5,  .8 ] } } },    // flat faces
```

Add params where you want two characters (or two species) to *differ*.
Don't parameterise for its own sake: every param is another knob in
the editor and another thing randomness can ruin.

## 9. Recipes for common jobs

**Add a variant to an existing part** (easiest, most common): add the
name to that part's weighted table in `gen`, add it to the `pick` list
in `meta`, and add an `else if` branch in `draw`. Nothing else. It is
immediately available to every species.

**Add a species:** see §8. Data only, no drawing.

**Add a new part type:** copy `src/parts/body.js` (Torso is a
single-bone part, Arms/Legs are mirrored pairs), fill in the contract
above, register it in `src/parts/index.js` at the right draw order.

**Add a drawing technique:** add a method to `Sketch` in `sketch.js`,
then expose it through the media that should use it.

**Add a medium:** add an entry to `MEDIA` in `media.js` with
`tone`/`skin`/`edge`/`underdraw`. It appears in both scenes' selectors
automatically.

**Add a body-relative anchor:** extend `bodyLayout()` in `layout.js`
and read it from `F.B`.

**Add a pose:** copy the nearest file in `src/poses/`, register it in
`src/poses/index.js`. Handle the three bases. The contract is at the
top of the registry.

**Add an expression:** one entry in `src/expressions.js`. If it needs
a face nobody can draw, first add that as a *state* of the eye, brow
or mouth part (one branch in its `draw()`), then point at it from
`states`.

**Add an item family:** see §10. One file, one line in
`src/items/index.js`.

---

## 10. Objects — the item system

### The one idea: the stats ARE the drawing

An item is a seeded bag of params, and that same bag drives `draw()`
**and** `statsOf()`. A sword that rolled a long blade *is* drawn long
and *does* reach further; a lantern with a fat bowl *is* drawn fat and
*does* light a bigger circle. You can read an item's power off the
paper the way you can read a character's species off its ears.

Two rules fall out of that, and they are the ones to enforce in
review: **never add a stat with no visible consequence**, and **never
draw a feature that means nothing.**

### One drawing, three hosts

Every family draws itself **once**, in a `REF`-sized box (96 px) with
the origin at its **anchor** and up **negative** — the same convention
`scenery.js` uses. `stamp()` then plants that drawing wherever it is
needed:

```
the draft card   ·   the floor prop   ·   the fist of a child
```

The anchor is the **grip** for `held`/`offhand`, the **head contact**
for `worn`, the **base** for standing floor things, and the **centre**
for flat things and charms.

**It scales through `ctx.scale`, never by multiplying the numbers.**
That matters more than it looks: every decision inside `Sketch` (the
`w >= 1.2` granulation gate, the 2.2 px resample floor, the `n < 3`
bail to a plain line) is made in *user* units, before the transform.
Scaling the canvas gives the identical drawing — grain and all — at
another size. Scaling your own numbers crosses those thresholds,
shifts the whole random stream, and quietly gives you a *different*
item. Keep the factor inside roughly `[.6, 2]`; `REF = 96` was chosen
so all three hosts land in that band.

### Ranks are a medium, not a colour

| rank | look | roll | mods |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sketch` | plain graphite, one contour | ×.85–1.05 | 0 |
| `inked` | a second, confident darker pass | ×1.0–1.25 | 1 |
| `gilded` | gleam ticks + a lighter inner fill | ×1.2–1.5 | 2 |
| `nightmare` | dense scribble, barbs, a harder line | ×1.5–2.0 | 2 **+ a curse** |

Every family closes its shapes through **`finish(s, pts, rank, o)`**,
which is to items what `F.media.*` is to parts. No family may draw its
own rank look — that is what keeps the whole catalogue legible and
lets a twelfth family arrive without breaking the ladder. Pass
`{ F }` through when the item is being drawn *on a character*, and
`finish` routes it through that character's own medium.

`nightmare` is the devil deal: the best numbers in the game on an
object drawn by *them*, and it always carries a curse.

### Favour — the toybox learns what you like

Picking a family makes it both **commoner** and **better**: its draft
weight rises and its rank ladder tilts, while every other family
fades. There is no pool to maintain and no currency — favour is just a
multiplier over generation, which is what keeps the whole economy
procedural.

### The hand — what a draft is made of

`HAND` in `items/index.js` is the shape of a draft: one **lamp** and
four from the **kit**. The lamp is guaranteed because seeing is the
only thing the room can run out of, and a draft that failed to offer
it killed the run by shuffle rather than by anything you did. The
light group is `kind: 'light'` **minus `floor`** — every card in a
draft is something a child carries, because a floor lantern is a place
and a place is worthless to a class that never stands still. Favour
still steers *which* family and *what rank* inside each group, and the
kit half is where the gamble lives.

`Toy` and `Bed` are still registered, still drawn and still on
`items.html`, but no group picks them: the room stopped dealing
furniture when it stopped having any. A family is a drawing first and
a game rule second, so they were left in rather than deleted.

The card copy is three separate statements — `copy.what` (flavour),
`copy.does` (the numbers, read off the bag) and `copy.costs` (the
curse) — printed as three paragraphs, because run together as one
sentence the upgrade hides inside the flavour. `desc` keeps the joined
one-liner for tooltips.

Names are **bare** — `nameItem` returns "long inked bat", not "a long
inked bat". A name is a card heading and a kit row far more often than
it is a word in a sentence; `withArticle()` puts the article back for
the log lines, which are prose.

### The family contract

```js
export const Sword = {
  id: 'sword', slot: 'held', noun: 'sword', weight: 10,
  // floor families also declare kind: 'light' | 'toy' | 'bed'
  gen(rng, C)  { ... },   // C = { rank, pow, wpick }; pow is the rank's multiplier
  statsOf(P)   { return { add: {...}, mul: {...} } },   // PURE
  fxOf(P)      { ... },   // fear / sticky / throw / chill / lull / thrift / familiar
  patchOf(P)   { ... },   // mutation slot: a recipe patch
  objOf(P)     { ... },   // floor slot: { kind, wU, hU, r, fuel, dur, play, rest }
  adj(P), desc(P),        // the name and one line of card copy
  draw(s, P, F) { ... },  // REF space, origin at the anchor, up negative
};
```

Slots: `held` · `offhand` · `worn` · `charm` · `mutation` · `floor`.

**The drawing must be deterministic from `P`.** This is the rule that
bites. The same art is baked once as a floor prop but re-drawn every
boil frame as a character part — so anything decided with `s.jr()`
*shimmers* at 1 Hz on a child. Every shape, count and position comes
from `P`, rolled in `gen()`. `s.jr()` is only for sub-linewidth
jitter, which is the boil and is wanted.

### How an item reaches a body

`src/parts/gear.js` registers three normal parts. Their params are
deliberately tiny — `{ family, rank, seed }` — and the shape is
re-derived (memoised) from them, so a recipe stays small and JSON
round-trips, and the object in the fist is guaranteed to be the object
the card showed.

**The gear bone sits at the SHOULDER, not the hand.** Bones are flat
siblings; there is no parenting in the rig. So a held bone is placed
at exactly the arm's origin and `anim.js` hands it the arm's finished
transform in a second pass (`GEAR`), which makes the object swing
correctly in every pose — including poses nobody has written yet. The
item is then drawn at the hand's own coordinates, which `layout.js`
publishes as **`B.grip(side)`** — the muzzle lesson again: publish
where the thing landed, and the parts that sit on it never learn how
it got there. `Arms.draw` reads the same anchor, so the two can never
disagree.

Draw orders: `Held`/`Offhand` take **0** (the one free slot: in front
of the arm, still behind the head), and `Worn` shares **7** with
`Crest`, winning on registry order the way Eyes/Nose/Mouth already do.
The rig's 16-slot block is otherwise full — see §6b before choosing
anything else.

### What an object can actually do

Beyond the stat bag, `fxOf(P)` returns effects the room reads. **Units
are the contract**: everything is a radius in world units except
`sticky` (seconds) and `throw` (an object). Return a 0–1 "strength"
where a radius is expected and it silently never fires — the room is
26 units across, so a believable earshot is 2 to 6.

| effect | what it does | drawn as |
|---|---|---|
| `fear` | on a hit, every nightmare in range flinches | a chalk ring |
| `chill` | nightmares in range are mired — light no longer does this, so a charm is the only thing that can | a chalk ring |
| `lull` | children in range get their courage back faster | a chalk ring |
| `thrift` | lanterns in range burn longer | a chalk ring |
| `sticky` | a nightmare this child hits stays mired | — |
| `throw` | the child lobs a drawn marble while fighting | a flying billboard |
| `familiar` | a live doodle animal trails the child and bites | a whole character |

A familiar is a **real character**, built from the same rig as
everybody else, so it can be a cat, a dog or a small nightmare
depending on what the doll was made in the shape of. It is the only
thing in the room with a mind of its own — which is exactly why it
belongs to an object and not to a child: the rule that *children do
nothing on their own* has to stay true, and an object is allowed to be
the exception because you chose it.

**Energy is the join.** The dark burns it, a bed gives it back, and at
zero the child goes home — so anything that adds `maxStam` or lowers
`drain` buys time in the same currency a lantern buys. That is what
makes a shield, a crown or a hat worth as much as a sword, and it is
why every point of it has to be real.

There is deliberately **no morale stat**. An earlier draft had `nerve`
and a nightmare `menace`, and a child could freeze and refuse orders;
it is gone. A child that will not do what you clicked is a child you
cannot read, and the three numbers on the card are the whole contract.

### Mutations rebuild the child

A `mutation` item has no drawing on the body at all: it merges a
**recipe patch** and rebuilds the character. That costs ~20 ms, so it
may only ever happen while the draft has the world stopped. Three
things must be re-pointed on a rebuild or they rot silently: the
cached material list (the light tint would keep writing to disposed
materials and the new child would never light), the feet lift (the
animator never writes `face.group`), and the depth rank (a fresh face
has `rank === null`, which the board sort re-stamps for free). The
animator's getter must read the **live** face — `() => k.face`, never
a closure over the original.

---

## 11. The voxel generator (`voxel.html`, `src/voxel/`)

A second character generator built on the same idea and sharing almost
no code with the first: a **recipe** goes in, parts are asked for their
params, a **layout** computes every shared measurement, and each part
builds itself — except that a part here places **cells**, not strokes,
and what comes out is a solid you can walk around.

```
              vspecies.js  (loads the dice)
                   │
recipe ──► gen() ──┴──► params ──► vlayout.js ──► V (head profile,
                                       │           anchors, palette)
        vparts/index.js ───────────────┼──► build(v, P, st, V) → cells
                                       ▼
                                    vrig.js ──► one mesh per part
                                                per state ──► vanim.js
```

The same three levers, deliberately independent:

| Lever | Answers | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **species** | *what creature is it* | `vspecies.js` — biases generation only |
| **palette** | *what is it made of* | `vpalette.js` — graphite, crayon, clay, gloom, candy |
| **params** | *which individual is it* | the recipe itself |

It keeps its own copy of the casting helper and its own species table
on purpose. The two generators share an *idea*, not a runtime, and a
change to the drawn one must not be able to break this one. The only
thing imported across is `rng.js`, which is arithmetic.

### Coordinates — and they are NOT the drawn rig's

Integers, **y up**, **+z toward the viewer** (so the face is on the +z
side), x mirrored about 0, and the origin is the **floor between the
feet**: cell `y = 0` is the lowest layer and its underside sits at
world y = 0, so standing a character on a floor is `position.y = 0`.

That is a deliberate break from the drawn rig's px/y-down/origin-at-the-head
convention. There is no canvas to hang off here, and a solid wants to
be measured from the ground it stands on. Widths and depths are
**half-extents**, so every dimension is odd and exactly symmetric —
which is what makes `v.sym()` exact instead of half a voxel off.

`VX` (world units per voxel, 1/16) is resolution only. Every
measurement in the generator is in whole voxels.

### The hand (`carve.js`)

`sketch.js` draws; this carves. A part never touches three.js — it
calls `set` / `dab` / `disc` / `blob` / `stroke` / `sym` on a `Carve`
and hands back a bag of coloured cells.

**`dab` vs `set` is the distinction to learn.** `set` adds a solid;
`dab` only recolours a cell that some EARLIER part already filled. A
spot, a blush, a sock, an eye — anything that lives on a surface rather
than adding to a silhouette — is dabbed, and then it can never float in
mid-air no matter what shape the body under it turned out to be.

`disc`/`blob` are superellipses: `n` is the whole shape family in one
number (2 is a ball, 4 a rounded box, 8 a box with the corners knocked
off). That is the voxel answer to the drawn skull's `radius(ang)`.

`h01(x,y,z,salt)` is a positional **hash**, not an rng: spots, freckles
and grain are placed from it, so they are stable across rebuilds and
across states and nothing shimmers. The drawn version's boil is
welcome; a solid's is not.

### The mesher, and the one trap in it

One `BufferGeometry` per part per state. Interior faces are culled
against the **whole character's** occupancy, not the part's own, which
is what welds a head to a torso instead of stacking two boxes. Two
things are baked into vertex colours rather than lit at runtime: a
fixed **face shade** (so it cannot swim when the camera orbits, and no
lights are needed) and **corner AO** — the classic voxel trick, three
lookups per corner, and the single thing that stops a model reading as
a pile of cubes. Geometry is opaque and depth-tested, so unlike the
drawn scenes there is no `renderOrder` to keep straight.

> **`cross(u, v)` must equal `n`** for every entry in `FACES`. Get it
> wrong and that face comes out wound backwards and is back-face
> culled — which does not look like a missing face, it looks like the
> whole model rendered inside-out and a shade too dark. Two of the six
> were wrong when this was written and it took a floor to notice.

Because culling crosses group boundaries, anything that MOVES relative
to its neighbour has to **overlap** it. The head sinks two voxels into
the shoulders (`neckY` in `vlayout.js`) so that a head cocking toward a
glance can never swing the culled seam into view.

### Build order is ownership

`vparts/index.js` is an ordered list, and that order is the whole story:

1. Every part builds its **resting** cells in registry order into one
   shared grid. Later parts overwrite earlier ones, so each cell ends
   up owned by **exactly one** part.
2. Each part is then meshed on its own, drawing only the cells it owns.

So a later part does not cover an earlier one, it **takes the cell** —
nothing is ever drawn twice and there is no z-fighting to sort out.
That is why the face is listed after the skull (an eye takes the skin
cell it sits on), and why the marks are listed *before* the hair and
the face (a spot must never land on a hairstyle or an eye).

### The plate rule

**Every state of a part must fill the same cells. Only the colours may
change.** A blink is then a visibility swap between two meshes built
once — two boolean writes — and because the footprint never moves,
swapping one in cannot leave a hole in the head.

The rig is forgiving and the audit is not: a cell a state forgets keeps
its resting colour, and a cell a state invents that some later part
owns is silently invisible. `auditPlates(face)` builds every state of
every part and reports both. It is the one bug class this design can
still have, it is decidable, and it costs a console call.

### The head profile lives in the LAYOUT

`V.contains(x,y,z)` and `V.frontZ(x,y)` are the head's own solid test,
and they live in `vlayout.js`, not in the Skull part. Skull fills them
in; every face part paints onto the surface they describe, asking each
column for its own front. So an eye wraps around a round head and sits
flat on a boxy one without the eye part knowing which it got — and when
a species grows a muzzle, the profile swells, `frontZ` reports the new
tip, and the nose and the mouth climb onto the snout without ever
learning that muzzles exist. That is the muzzle lesson from §8, and it
is why the face parts are a few lines each.

`V.crownY(x,z)` and `V.edgeX(y,z)` are published for the same reason:
ears, hats and hair root themselves by asking, never by assuming a head
size.

> **A hairline is a HEIGHT, not a column top.** "Cover the topmost
> solid cell of every column" sounds like a shell and is not: on the
> front of a round head a column is a couple of cells halfway down the
> face, so that rule lays hair across the cheeks and a hat brim over
> the eyes. Cover by absolute y — then the three fractions in `CUT`
> (front, side, back) are an actual haircut.

### Bases

`recipe.base` is `biped` or `quad`, picked by the species. It changes
exactly two things, the same mechanism as §8: `vlayout.js` branches and
publishes different anchors, and parts declare `base: ['biped']` /
`['quad']` so the rig skips the rest. Arms and Legs are biped-only,
Legs4 is quad-only, and everything above the neck is shared untouched.
A quad lies along z with its front at 0 and carries its head out in
front, sunk into the shoulders.

### Animation — breath and face, and nothing else

There is no line boil to keep a solid alive and no poses to blend, so
all the life comes from two places:

- **The breath.** The body group swells about the feet and the head
  group rides up *exactly* the amount the chest grew under it. The head
  is a sibling of the body, not a child, so it has to be told — and
  that one coupling is the difference between a character breathing and
  a head bobbing next to a torso.
- **The face.** Blink, glance, talk and expression, all of them
  visibility swaps between pre-built meshes. Expressions land while the
  eyes are shut, the same trick `anim.js` uses: a discrete swap is
  invisible behind a blink and obvious without one. The body language
  that goes with a mood is continuous and rides its own crossfade.
- Plus two garnishes: `animator.hop()` is a one-shot jump with
  anticipation and landing squash (the crowd's director calls it), and
  half of all glances cock the whole head toward what was noticed —
  the puzzled-puppy tilt, one rotation.

The glance is worth one note: in 3D the head really turns (`rotation.y`),
which is the one move a drawn billboard could never make. And both eyes
must look the **same way** — `Eyes` deliberately does not use `v.sym()`,
because mirroring x would flip the glance and give you a walleyed child.

### Verifying it

The decidable half, all from the console on `voxel.html`:

```js
__voxel.audit()                     // the plate rule, per part per state
__voxel.stats()                     // voxels, tris, height, build ms
await __voxel.pump(240)             // drive the animation by hand
```

`pump()` stops the real rAF loop first and carries on from the last
frame's clock. Both matter: interleaved real frames run on a different
clock, and restarting at `performance.now()` rewinds the virtual one so
every `dt` clamps to zero and the animator quietly stops advancing.
`frame()` clamps `dt` at **both** ends for the same reason — a negative
`dt` runs the gaze spring backwards and it reaches 1e36 in about twenty
frames.

Measured, over 120 characters across every species and palette: a build
is ~9 ms median and ~30 ms worst case (comparable to a drawn one), a
character is 1000–3500 voxels and 2000–5000 triangles.

### Recipes for common jobs

**Add a part:** one file in `src/voxel/vparts/`, one line in
`vparts/index.js` at the right build order. The contract is
`{ id, label, group, states?, base?, species?, gen, meta, skip?, build }`
and `build(v, P, st, V)` is the whole job.

**Add a species:** one entry of weights in `vspecies.js`. Data only.

**Add a palette:** one entry in `vpalette.js`. It shows up in the editor
and the recipe automatically. Note what `gloom` does: it INVERTS the
eye, because a black void on near-black skin is a face you cannot see.
That decision belongs to the material, which is the point of having one.

**Add an expression:** one entry in `VFACES` in `vanim.js`, naming a
state per part id. If it needs a face nobody can make, add that state to
the eye/brow/mouth part first — and obey the plate rule.

**Add a head shape:** one row in `SHAPES` in `vlayout.js` plus its name
in `Skull.gen`'s pick list.

### The voxel crowd (`voxelcrowd.html`, `src/voxel/vcrowd.js`)

Twenty characters on an exact grid, all facing the camera, on a
midnight platform — spiral hill curling over a voxel moon, bare trees,
lit pumpkins — under three coloured lanterns that orbit on their own
clocks. The scenery is ONE Carve and one mesh, so the mesher welds it
and the AO pools where a tree meets the ground.

Three things this page does that nothing else here may:

- **Real lights.** Characters are built `lit: true`: the fixed face
  shading stays out of the vertex colours (a baked key light fights a
  lamp that moves) and the material is Lambert; AO and grain stay baked
  because occlusion is geometry, not illumination. ACES tone mapping,
  a shadow-casting moon key light, a soft front fill (the moon is
  BEHIND a crowd that faces the camera — without the fill it rims
  twenty backs and shows nobody's face), and one lantern dragging real
  shadows. Glow sprites are additive with `depthTest: false` — a
  billboarded quad crossing the moon's own plane depth-fails on one
  side of the intersection and prints a hard diagonal seam across the
  disc.
- **The mount.** A character assembles voxel by voxel: the rig sorts
  every mesh's triangles bottom-up (with hash jitter, so it speckles),
  and the scene sweeps `geometry.setDrawRange` from 0 to full over
  ~1.4 s. No geometry is touched at runtime, and the shadow assembles
  with the body because shadow maps render the same geometry. The
  animator is gated until the mount ends — a body should not breathe
  until it has finished existing.
- **A parked camera.** Nothing animates it; drag still orbits. On this
  page the light is the animation.

The platform needed cell coordinates out to ±108, which is why `KOFF`
in carve.js is 128 (range −128…127) rather than 64.

## 12. The molded generator (`gloss.html`, `src/gloss/`)

A THIRD generator, on the same idea and sharing no runtime with the
other two (only `rng.js` crosses over, and it is arithmetic). A recipe
goes in, parts are asked for their params, a layout measures once, and
each part builds itself — except that what a part hands back here is
neither strokes nor cells but a bag of SPECS, and what comes out is a
glossy 3d chibi character — a real character, not a figurine.

```
recipe ──► gen() ──► params ──► glayout.js ──► L (at(), radii, colours)
                                    │
     gparts/index.js ───────────────┴──► build(add, P, L) → specs
                                             │
                                    grig.js ─┴─► gshape.js ──► meshes
                                                 gmedia.js ──► materials
```

**It is all solid geometry.** An earlier version built the body as a
signed distance field and meshed it with surface nets, and that is
gone. The reason is worth keeping: an eye is a thousandth of a body,
so resolving one meant resolving the whole grid at eye scale — the
sockets still came out faceted at 136 samples, a character cost two seconds,
and the fine detail was exactly what the sampling could not afford.
Solids have no resolution to trade. A sphere is a sphere at any zoom
and a character costs a few milliseconds.

### Coordinates

World units, **y up**, **+z toward the viewer** (so the face is on the
+z side), origin at the **floor under the character**. Same break from the
drawn rig as the voxel lab, and for the same reason: a solid wants
measuring from the ground it sits on.

### The hand (`gshape.js`)

`sketch.js` draws, `carve.js` carves, this one **cuts and stamps**. It
makes exactly two things:

- a **solid** — the body, the odd lump like a button nose, and the
  ball eye's three pieces (a `dome` fraction cuts a solid into an open
  cap, made for exactly one thing: that eye's lid);
- a **plate** — every other face feature. An outline, extruded,
  bevelled;
- a **skull** — the humanoid's head, and the one body that is not a
  formula. Built in `gskull.js`, packed here.

The plate is the whole face system and it is one shape of thing on
purpose. The bevel is the cartoon read: it is what catches the studio
highlight around the edge of an eye, and it is why a feature looks
moulded into the character rather than printed on it.

> **Authoring rule.** A plate's front crest sits at `z = 0` and its
> body runs BACKWARD. Placed on the skin it is therefore flush, and
> `proud` is the single number that lifts it out. Because the body
> runs backward and the surface curves away underneath, a plate can
> never float off the silhouette — which is exactly what a centred
> solid did do.

A mouth, a brow and a closed lid are the SAME object: a **band**, one
stroke of constant width along a centreline. So `ribbon()` plus a
table of curves (`line`, `arc`, `wave`, `zig`) gives that whole
family, and adding a mouth shape is adding a *curve*, not a polygon.

### The face never learns the body

`L.at(ax, ay)` takes a face coordinate — across, up, both about −1…1 —
and returns the point on the body and the normal there. On an
ellipsoid that is arithmetic: nothing is sampled, marched or resolved.

Every face part places itself through `at` and nothing else, so the
second body shape (a star, a heart, a rock) inherits the entire face
catalogue by providing one function. That is the muzzle lesson, third
time.

> the centre. Use the centre and every feature on a squashed body tips
> off true.

### The skull that was here, and why it went

For a while the humanoid had a third body form: `head`, a modeled chibi
skull — a control cage of rings put through Catmull-Clark subdivision,
ported from the `chibi-skull` study, with `L.at` raycasting the real
subdivided surface. It worked, and it is gone.

Two things are worth keeping from it. The first is why it existed: a
chin-tuck knob was bolted onto the superellipsoid first, in three
shapes (linear = flowerpot, quadratic = teardrop, smoothstep with a
jaw-depth knob = still not a skull), and none of it read, because one
implicit formula cannot say *full cheeks here, chin this wide, face
flat in front*. **A shape you can name the parts of wants a cage, not
an exponent.** That is true and still worth knowing.

The second is why it left anyway: this lab makes CHIBI CHARACTERS. A
sphere or a cube with a face on it is one; an anatomically-argued skull
is a different register, and it sat in the line-up looking like it had
wandered in. Everything the skull was carrying — the hair, the face
catalogue, the proportions — turned out to sit on a ball perfectly
well. A form that is right in isolation and wrong in the line-up is
wrong.

### The hair (`ghair.js`) — one molded mass, carved

Hair is the humanoid's, and the fourth kind of thing the lab builds.
Getting its NOUN right took three attempts, and the sequence is the
lesson:

1. **One smooth shell** — a helmet. Nothing broke the surface, nothing
   caught the light: a swim cap.
2. **Separate tiled clumps** — gaps opened onto bare skin, every tile
   rim caught the studio as a glassy streak, and a head of loose tiles
   has no VOLUME: it hugs the skull it was meant to stand off.
3. **One thick closed mass with the clumps CARVED into it** — which is
   what the reference figures actually are: a single piece of molded
   vinyl, fat off the head, with grooves run from the crown and a hem
   that drops to a point under each clump.

The build is one closed shell with torus topology: the outer surface
climbs hem → crown, folds over, and the inner surface comes back down
hugging the head — no caps, no seams, no bare skin, and the fold at the
hem is the thick rounded rim every molded haircut has. Onto that:

- **grooves**: narrow notches in the outer radius at each clump
  boundary. They converge at the crown because everything is
  parametrised by (azimuth, height) and that converges at the pole by
  itself — the whorl comes free. They FADE toward the crown, though:
  their physical width goes to nothing up there, and at full depth the
  whorl turns into a star of spikes.
- **scallop**: the hem drops to a tip under each clump's middle,
  sine-powered so the tip is a point and the shoulders are round, each
  clump's depth jittered. An even hem reads as a cut line; a scalloped
  one reads as hair ENDING.
- boundaries are JITTERED off even spacing — the eye reads a repeat
  before it reads the hair.

**It is combed from a WHORL, not from the top pole.** The first carving
used plain azimuth, so every groove was a meridian and they all met at
the geometric top of the head — a pumpkin, not a haircut. The grooves
now follow a FLOW FIELD: each is a great-circle ray out of a placeable
whorl point, set back off the crown by default, nudged per head, swung
aside for parted styles and pulled to the front hairline for the
upswept ones — so the fringe's grooves run forward-and-down over the
forehead and the back's run down the nape, the way combed hair lies.
The hem's scallop is indexed by the same field, so the tips and the
grooves above them always agree about the combing.

**The point strands.** A molded mass alone still looks like it came out
of a mold; what reads as STYLED is the accent strands, and the
decomposition is exactly how the reference figures are molded (a back
piece, a front piece, and separate strands): the MOMIAGE hanging in
front of each ear — built only where the ear region is exposed, because
on a bob the mass already falls past the ear and a lock riding outside
it reads as a ridge — and the FRINGE WISPS, strands that hang PAST the
fringe's hem close to the skin. The wisps were flow-marched along the
surface first and read as antennae at every length: a strand crossing
the outer surface at an angle is a stick, wherever it points; HANGING
is a direction that cannot be misread. Every root starts inside the
mass. A third family — crown flyaways — was cut after three tuning
rounds: a tube on the crown's convex silhouette never reads, and the
one strand that belongs up there is the AHOGE, which is already its own
deliberate feature. A wisp the tuning cannot save is a wisp the design
does not want.

The hem — front/side/back, by azimuth — is still the whole haircut, and
the ORDERING is still the read: fringe high, temples lower, nape
lowest.

But three numbers only give a LENGTH, and length alone made every head
the same haircut: a blunt fringe ruled straight across the brow, which
is a bowl cut, nineteen times over. Styling needs the fringe's SHAPE as
its own dimension, and there are three:

| lever | what it does |
|---|---|
| `part` | runs the fringe diagonally — long over one brow, high at the opposite temple |
| `curtain` | raises it over the nose and drops it at both temples, so the forehead shows between two falling sides |
| `pomp` | sweeps it UP: the hem sits high on the forehead and the mass lifts above it |

`pomp` is the one that needed geometry rather than a hem number. A
radial push cannot make an upswept fringe — it just makes a fatter
helmet — so it displaces the outer surface UP and FORWARD over the
front of the head. It peaks between the hairline and the crown and
returns to zero at both, because the outer surface meets the inner one
at the crown and a lift carried into that fold would tear the mass
open.

The lengths needed a third band too. There was a hole between `bob` (at
the jaw) and `long` (past the chest) — the media melena, which is the
commonest length there is. `midi`, `layers` and `wavy` live there now. Level all round is a cap sitting on the head; level from nose
to ear cuts the head on a straight line. Long cuts hold the face arc
further round (`open`) or they close into a hood. Below the fall line
the mass keeps the head's silhouette and simply descends, which is what
falling hair does. All per-clump variation comes off ONE rolled seed —
hair is rebuilt every boil frame, and anything re-rolled per frame
shimmers.

Hair is **dead-matte vinyl**, and the material block records two
failures of its own: a hard clearcoat (one travelling hotspot on a
shape whose whole job is many soft clumps — a plastic wig) and then a
strong whitened sheen (sheen is a rim lobe, so on a grooved surface it
lit every groove edge as a glassy streak — cellophane). The reference
hair is the flattest thing on the character: the grooves read by occlusion
and the studio gradient, not by any highlight. Matte comes from
ROUGHNESS, never from dimming `envMapIntensity` — that just makes every
colour darker than its swatch.

Tails, buns and the ahoge are separate pieces — tubes framed by
parallel transport (a fixed up-vector spins where the path turns
vertical and pinches the tube into an hourglass), and a bun is the
body's own solid. A tail's stand-off scales with the HEAD, never the
hair's length. One generator covers the sphere and the cube, because
both are the same superellipsoid and `surfT` carries the exponent.

**Colour is its own table** (`HAIR_COLORS`), never the body's palette:
the five-colour set is what makes a sheet one cast, and hair is
what tells two heads apart. Two facts belong to the PAIR rather than to
either colour, so the LAYOUT owns both: the brow is the head's own hair
pulled toward ink, and hair within a sixth of the skin in luma is
pushed off it — rolled independently, a third of the sheet had a
haircut you could only find by its silhouette, and that is 4% now.

Hair casts a shadow (`spec.cast`) where no other feature does, names
its own finish, and `gface.js` leaves it alone: every other feature
slides a little with the gaze because it is painted on a turning face,
but hair IS the head, and a second offset slides the cut off the skull.

### The extras — spectacles, hats, marks

Three parts that are not what a character IS but what it is WEARING, or
what has HAPPENED to it: `specs.js`, `hat.js`, `mark.js`. All three are
dealt rare (88/86/82% none), for the reason the brows already record —
an accessory on everyone stops being character and becomes the house
style.

Each one needed a fact it could not know, and in every case the part
that owns it PUBLISHES it and the layout hands it over. That is now
three instances of the same edge (`eyeReach` was the first):

| publisher | fact | who needs it |
|---|---|---|
| `eyes.js` | `eyeProud` — how far the eye's front stands off the skin | spectacles: an `orb` is a ball standing ¾ of its radius out, and a lens placed for a flat plate cuts through the eyeball |
| `ghair.js` | `hairOuter` — the hair's outer radius | a hat that PERCHES (band, bow, flower, crown) |
| `hat.js` | `hatBare` — whether this hat is worn on a bare head | the hair, which builds nothing |

**A hat either hugs or perches, and that split is the whole design.**
A bow, a flower and a crown PERCH: they sit on top of whatever is up
there and want `L.hairTop`. A beanie and a headband are pulled ON, and
there is no size at which one shares a skull with a haircut. Sized to
clear a big cut it stands a whole hair's volume off the skull at every
height, including down at the ears where there is no hair — a bowl
balanced on the head. Sized to the skull it vanishes underneath.
Squashing the hair under its rim was built next, and it worked, and
the two still fought for the same few millimetres at every seed. So a
pulled-on hat is simply worn on a BARE head, which is a real look and
needs no negotiation: `hatBare` says so and `ghair.js` builds nothing.

**Hats are HUMAN.** The part's own default is `none` at 100, so the
humanoid's profile is the only table that deals them — a bear in a
beanie is one line away and it is not one anybody wanted.

Spectacles are frames and a BRIDGE and nothing else. There were temple
arms, and they are gone: an arm has to start at the frame and run back
along the head, and a plate lands on a tangent plane — placed out at
the temple it began in mid-air with a gap behind the lens, and placed
on the lens's own basis it flew off the side of the head as the
surface curved away. The bridge itself had the same disease in
miniature, sized in FACE coordinates against a world width, which is
not a unit at all: it came out short and floated in the gap. It is
measured off the lens centre's own x now, with an overlap that runs it
into both frames. A join you can see is the only kind there is.

**Accessories have their own colour table** (`ACC_COLORS`), for exactly
the reason hair does. A character's five are what make a sheet one
cast, so an extra drawn from them cannot be seen — and on a humanoid it
is fatal, because every colour in the `skin` palette IS a skin tone.
The first beanie came out as a bald head. `pickAcc` then guarantees
clearance from BOTH the body and the hair, scored on **full RGB
distance and not luma**: scored on lightness alone a terracotta beats a
teal against peach skin, and then renders as another shade of face,
because it is the same hue and the key light is warm.

And they wear the `acc` finish rather than the character's. Left to inherit
it, a beanie on a humanoid is poured in `skin`. `acc`'s sheen is
SELF-COLOURED — `rubber`'s white one washed a brick red out to pale
pink under the overhead key, which is the same mistake the hair block
already records, made a second time.

### The face is APPLIED, and that is what makes it animate

Nothing is carved and nothing is welded: each eye, brow, nose, mouth
and cheek is its own mesh, returned from the rig as a `face` map. That
map is the animation surface — a blink is `eyeL.scale.y`, a glance is
a nudge in x, and neither costs a rebuild. `blinkScale(clock)` is the
curve; feed it a PER-CHARACTER clock, because twenty characters blinking on
the same frame reads as a glitch in the renderer rather than as twenty
things being alive.

The reference's carved-then-raised eye was tried here as a **rim** —
the same outline a size larger, in a darkened body tone, sitting just
under the feature — and removed. Against saturated vinyl a shade like
that reads as shadow, but these palettes are pale and low-contrast, so
it came out as a second COLOUR rather than a darker one; and with no
concavity behind it, nothing said "recess" either. It read as two
stacked shapes, because that is what it was.

> **A shadow comes from geometry and the studio, never from a colour

One eye is not a plate: the **orb** (the humanoid's, the Rabbid
construction) is three solids — a white sphere sunk a third into the
head, an ink bead sunk into the sphere so it can never float, and a
body-colour dome cap centred exactly on the ball. The cap is why it is
worth having: a blink is the cap ROLLING about the ball's centre
(`lidRoll`), so a lid closes over a sphere with one rotation and no
geometry. Three rules were paid for: the ball is a SPHERE by decree
(an ellipsoid lid cannot roll — turned 120° its short axis faces the
ball's long one and the pupil punches through the shell); the hinge is
the WORLD x-axis, not the lid's own (a wide-set eye's basis tips ~30°
off camera and a lid rolled about it closes sideways, leaving a rim of
white); and the cap's rest axis is tipped BACK so at rest it reads as
a heavy lid over the top third instead of swallowing the front where
the pupil lives. The pupil's crown must stay inside the cap's shell —
sunk .7 of its radius, shell at 1.16 of the ball — or every shut lid
has a black dot punching through it.

### The four levers

| Lever | Answers | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **species** | *what creature is it* | `gspecies.js` — biases generation only |
| **body** | *what shape is it* | sphere or cube; one exponent |
| **palette + colour** | *what colour is it* | `gpalette.js` — twelve fives |
| **material** | *what is it made of* | `gmedia.js` |

Everything else — which eyes, which mouth, how far apart — is rolled
per character from the seed, under whatever dice the species loaded.

The SPECIES is the third copy of the casting idea, and on purpose the
third copy of the code (only `rng.js` crosses generators). A profile
is a table of loaded dice per part id — object → weighted pick where
what you leave out cannot happen, array → range, number → probability
— and the compound characters arrive assembled: a panda is bear ears AND ink
eye patches AND a pale muzzle, rolled together instead of once a
thousand sheets. The humanoid is the same idea with the crest swapped
for HAIR (`tuft` / `mop` / `curl` — ink plates standing on the crown,
where everyone else's ears go) and the eyes loaded toward the orb.

A species may bias the body form; it must **never** touch the palette
or the material — what a character is made of is a separate question,
and a lavender panda is still a panda. The humanoid is the one exception the
rule was waiting for, and it may name both: it is poured in the `skin`
palette (four tones pale to deep plus a rosy fifth the blush always
scores as the warm one) and finished in the `skin` material (a broad
warm sheen for the fake-subsurface rim, a weak rough clearcoat for the
doll sheen). A chrome humanoid is not a humanoid in another finish, it
is a different object. `skin` is kept out of both random deals and
reachable only by name or by a pinned filter — which is why
`gmedia.js`'s reachability check now counts *named by a species* as a
second legitimate way for a material to reach a character.

Its face is deliberately **not** narrowed: the whole eye catalogue
rolls, weighted with the orb in front. Casting three eye styles gave
three characters wearing different colours, which is the failure the
`wildcard` slice exists to prevent.

What the species does pin is PROPORTION, and it is the one place in
the lab where the numbers were measured rather than judged —
*frente despejada, ojos a mitad de cara*:

| what | target | why |
|---|---|---|
| eye centre, down the head | **0.64** | the face hangs off the midline |
| eye **top**, down the head | **0.52** | the whole top half is forehead |
| eye width ÷ head width | **0.25** | a quarter of the face, each |
| eye centre ÷ half-width | **0.50** | wide-set, a full eye's gap |
| mouth, down the head | **0.77** | small and close under the eyes |

This inverts the lab's own upper-half rule, and that is correct: the
rule is about a CREATURE, where a face slung low reads as a smiley
drawn on a ball. A chibi head is not a ball with a face on it, it is a
skull, and the cranium above the eyes is the thing that makes it
read as one.

Guessing put the face too high and too small twice. `__probe` in the
lab console reports all five off the built meshes; average it over
~30 seeds, because one character is not a proportion. And the mouth is cast
SMALL and as a line: the reference mouth is a stroke a fraction of an
eye wide, and a big one also reaches further, so the layout's
clear-the-eyes push drops it onto the chin. A species may bias the body form; it must never touch
the palette or the material — what a character is made of is a separate
question, and a lavender panda is still a panda. `wildcard` (no
opinions at all) stays the biggest slice of the deal: the casting
exists to make compounds arrive whole, not to shrink the generator to
a fixed cast of eight.

`gpalette.js` holds twelve five-colour sets sampled from the reference
sheet. A character takes its body colour from one set and its warm bits
(blush, an open mouth) from **another colour in the same set**, which is
what stops a sheet of twenty looking like twenty unrelated characters.
`INK` is deliberately outside every palette: one warm near-black does
every eye, brow and mouth in the lab, and that single shared value is
most of the family resemblance.

The two materials have to differ in more than one number or the
toggle does nothing you can see across a sheet. Glossy is a hard
clearcoat over smooth plastic — one tight travelling highlight.
Rubber has no coat and a broad rough lobe, so it returns a soft even
glow with no hotspot, and leans harder on the environment to keep
from going dead flat.

### Adding things

- a **face part** = one file in `src/gloss/gparts/` + one line in its
  `index.js`. It never touches three.js: it names an outline from
  `gshape.js`, places through `L.at`, and takes colours off `L`.
- a **variant** of an existing part = one entry in that part's `STYLE`
  table. This is the cheap lever and it should be the usual answer.
- a **palette** = one entry in `gpalette.js`.
- a **stance** — head-only or biped — is `recipe.stance`; see "The
  stance" below. Species weight it the way they weight the body form.
- a **body** = a case in `formRad` and one entry in `BODY_WEIGHTS`.
  There are four. `sphere` and `cube` are the superellipsoid with its
  squareness knob; `rock` and `slime` are **profiled** — a surface of
  revolution over a SILHOUETTE, `formRad(form, az, v)` giving the
  horizontal radius at normalised height v. The sphere is the special
  case `sqrt(1 − v²)`, so a profile is a drop-in replacement and the
  whole face catalogue lands on it unchanged.

  > **A radial displacement cannot make either of them,** which is what
  > they were built as first. Scaling a ball in and out along the ray

  `rock` is flat on the bottom (the lower profile holds nearly full
  width to the last few percent, then turns a rounded rim) and domed on
  top, plus a little azimuthal lumping from FIXED harmonics — rolled
  per frame it would boil. `slime` is a drop: a wide round base
  swelling to the waist and tapering to a soft point.

  Two more things a profile changes. `hwAt` must read it — the peak of
  a drop is most of its height, and a feature guarded against `rx` up
  there sails off the silhouette. And the FACE follows the width: the
  lab's upper-half rule would put a slime's eyes on its spike, so a
  form may bias the face down toward the part of itself wide enough to
  carry one.

  Dealt weighted, never uniformly: the ball and the block carry the
  sheet and the two profiles are treats. Dealt evenly they were 40% of
  a sheet, and a rock is a strong enough silhouette that four in a row
  stop being a surprise.

### The stance (`gparts/frame.js`)

A character is head-only or a **biped** — `recipe.stance`, dealt like
the body form is: species weight it (`stance:` in a profile), head-only
carries the sheet, the lump species pin `none` because a slime with
legs contradicts what a slime is, and the humanoid pins `biped` — a
floating humanoid head is a decapitation, not a character. A modeled form
never takes a frame — its foot or base already IS its bottom — and a
stance PINNED by the crowd's filter excludes the modeled forms from
the body deal, so the filter never quietly un-filters itself. A `quad`
stance — four shoes under a slung horizontal pill — was built and cut:
seen from the front, the only angle the sheet has, it read as a worse
biped.

The frame is **Rayman anatomy**: no arms, no legs, no neck. The torso
is an upright pill — a superellipsoid taller than wide, squared just
enough (`belly` ≈ 2.4–3.2) that its sides run straight — the hands are
MITTS floating beside it, the feet are SHOES floating under it, and
the air in the gaps is load-bearing: it is what says "cartoon" instead
of "figurine". The head still sinks into the torso by a socket overlap —
the one joint that is a socket, not a gap. The head stays the character: the
whole frame adds about half a head of height, and the proportions are
measured off the HEAD's radius so the frame can never grow away from
the face it carries.

The frame wears an **outfit**, and the layout resolves it (`L.outfit`)
because it is all agreements: `pickOutfit` in `gpalette.js` deals cloth,
glove and shoe colours from `ACC_COLORS`, each scored to clear the skin,
the hair and the pieces already picked. Gloves and shoes are ALWAYS
coloured (`acc` finish — a bare biped in white gloves and red shoes is
the oldest character design there is); the torso is cloth only when
`dressed` rolls true — half the creatures, the humanoid pinned to 1 (a
skin torso on a person reads as naked), the robot at .1 (its torso is
its own chassis, chrome and all). A dressed torso may carry a **print**
— `clothPrint` in `gtexture.js`, the one place a texture is the right
tool for clothing, because a screen-printed star on a vinyl blank IS
print. The map carries the whole diffuse (cloth ground + motif ink, the
ink flipped light or dark against the cloth's luma) and the factory
sets the material colour to white — a map that only multiplied could
never put light ink on dark cloth. The chest sits at u = .25, v ≈ .55
of the sphere parametrisation; `none` carries the motif table, because
a print on every chest is a uniform, not a wardrobe.

The mitt and the shoe are MODELED — small control cages through
Catmull-Clark, the same verdict as the rock and the slime, because *a
shape you can name the parts of wants a cage*: a mitten has a palm and
one thumb swell (a cage vertex pushed out, so subdivision softens it —
no fingers), a shoe has a flat sole (two near-full rings at the
bottom, the rock's sitting-flat trick), a full toe and a lower heel.
Both are authored ONCE as the left one and mirrored (rewind the faces
or the normals face in), with no rng anywhere — a frame is rebuilt per
recipe and must never boil.

The split of labour is the muzzle rule again. `frameLayout` (in the
part, because the part knows what a frame is) returns plain numbers;
the LAYOUT calls it first, because the head's own height depends on the
answer, and publishes `L.frame` for the part's build() to stamp. The
face catalogue survives untouched — every face part places through
`L.at`, which simply sits higher.

> **The floor and the bottom of the head used to be the same y**, and
> the chin clamps in `glayout.js` leaned on that. With a frame they
> split (`botY`), and a clamp still measuring off the floor would run a
> maw down onto the chest.

In the rig the head is **its own group**, pivoted at its centre: the
gaze spring writes yaw/pitch to `built.head`, so a character with a torso
keeps its feet planted while it looks. `L.H` stays the HEAD's height —
the sheet normalises faces by it, and a head that shrank because it
grew a body would defeat the point — while the whole character's height lives
in `bounds`. Breathing stays what it was: the pages' volume-preserving
squash on the whole group.

### The face life (`gface.js`)

The autonomic half of `anim.js`, ported to a character with no bones. The
drawn rig's life is blink, gaze, sway and breath; only one of those
needs a skeleton, so the rest come over intact — and gaze is the one
that matters:

> **Something catches the eye, gets looked at, and is let go.** The
> EYES move first. Then the head WHIPS after them on a loose spring,
> overshooting and settling rather than easing into place. That
> overshoot is the whole difference between a cartoon head turning and
> a camera panning, which is why the spring is deliberately
> under-damped (high k, damping near 1). A third of the time the gaze
> is followed by its opposite, so a page of them never reads as
> everyone scanning the same room.

Here the character IS the head, so the spring drives the whole body, and the
page decides where to add `life.head` — the lab puts it on the group,
the sheet adds it to the cell position.

Expressions are OFFSETS, never drawings. A gloss face cannot swap a
mouth without rebuilding it, but it can raise a brow, narrow an eye
and open a mouth, which turns out to be most of what an expression is.
They blend by weight and a change pulls the next blink forward, so the
face turns over behind shut lids — the same trick the drawn rig uses
to hide a texture swap.

`gface.js` owns EVERY write to a feature mesh. Each frame it puts the
features back where the rig left them and re-applies the offsets, so
blink, gaze and expression can never fight over the same transform and
nothing accumulates drift.

### The sheet (`glosscrowd.html`, `src/gloss/gcrowd.js`)

The lab's opposite number, and the same page the other two generators
already have — but built like the DRAWN crowd, not the voxel one: a
flat grid seen straight on, seven across and five down, every character
the same size in its own cell.

It was a floor first, receding into depth, and that was the
wrong page. Depth costs the two things a contact sheet is for — the
back row is smaller than the front so you cannot compare them, and a
character that moves is moving away from you where it barely reads.

- **a wall, not a floor.** The characters hang on a plane about half a
  unit behind them, and that wall is what makes the light work: each one
  throws a short shadow onto it, so the sheet has depth without the
  camera needing any. The key is nearly head-on, only a little up and
  to the left — rake it harder and every shadow lands on the
  neighbour instead of reading as depth.
- **a real lens.** A long-ish 26° perspective, so the grid barely
  converges but the characters out at the edges still turn a few degrees
  toward you. An orthographic box was tried and reads as a printed
  page rather than objects on a wall.
- **the animation is all FACE.** There is no body-move director. A
  character hopping in its cell is a screensaver; the thing worth watching is
  thirty-five faces looking around a room and reacting to it. The
  vocabulary is entirely `gface.js`, and this page only decides who
  feels what and when — exactly the job `crowd.js`'s director does for
  poses, weighted toward idle so a face that does change is worth
  catching.
- **the count changes, never the scale.** A narrow window gets fewer
  columns rather than seven columns of nothing, and the camera always
  CONTAINS the grid: a contact sheet with a row cropped off is not a
  contact sheet.

The filter bar pins `body`, `palette` or `material` to one value or
leaves it rolling. Hold two still and the third is the only thing
varying, which is the only honest way to see whether a lever is doing
work. There is deliberately no face-part filter — a sheet with the
eyes pinned is not a product line, it is a spreadsheet. A pinned value
is written into the recipe BEFORE `ensureGParams` fills it in; every
field there uses `??=`, so it only ever rolls what it was not told.

`__gcrowd` exposes `slots / stats / frame / pump / refill / filter`.
Measure with `pump`, never by watching a hidden panel — a throttled
tab reports build times an order of magnitude out.

## 13. The plants generator (`objects.html`, `src/obj/`)

A FOURTH generator, on the same idea and sharing no runtime with the
other three (only `rng.js` crosses over). A recipe goes in, parts
roll their params, a layout measures once, and each part pushes SPECS
— except that a spec here is a leaf, a blade, a trunk or a blob, and
what comes out is a plastic plant on a cream nursery shelf.

```
recipe ──► gen() ──► params ──► olayout.js ──► L (rootY, crownY, leaf unit)
                                    │
        oparts/index.js ────────────┴──► build(add, P, L, C) → specs
                                             │
                                 orig.js ─┴─► oshape.js ──► meshes
                                            omedia.js ──► materials
```

It is the first generator whose species are SHAPES, not skins: a grass
tuft and a tree crown share almost no geometry, so the parts branch
hard on the style the species loads (`blades`, `rosette`, `crown`,
`sprig`, and the four blooms). The species table is `ospecies.js` —
the fourth copy of the casting idea, on purpose the fourth copy of
the code.

### Coordinates

World units, y up, +z toward the viewer, origin at the FLOOR under
the plant — the same break the voxel and gloss labs already made, for
the same reason: a solid wants measuring from the ground it sits on.

### The hand (`oshape.js`)

`sketch` draws, `carve` carves, this WARPS CURVES:

- **leaf / petal** — a flat outline extruded with a rim (the plastic
  read the gloss plates give the toys). The whole leaf family is one
  superellipse exponent `n`: 2.2 is the potted fern, 3.2 the shield.
  A `curl` in the spec cups the plate along its length (a flat leaf
  is a paddle; a cupped one is moulded) — and the bend re-welds its
  normals by position, because an extrude is non-indexed and a bent
  one facets without the weld.
- **blade** — a leaf that LEANS: the outline is a spine offset to
  each side by a width that dies at the tip, so the bend is BAKED
  INTO the geometry. The spine is INTEGRATED from a bend angle —
  march a fixed arc length along a monotonically bending heading —
  never offset in y: an offset spine folds back at a hard droop, the
  two edge curves cross, and the triangulator fills the loop as a
  slab (a tuft used to grow a few of those).
- **trunk** — a profile lathed around y, with the top sheared
  sideways by `lean` afterwards so a tree can grow toward the light
  instead of standing at attention. `taper` blends the cone toward a
  capped pole: 0 is the tree, ~.7 the flower's stalk — the cone
  version read as a traffic cone wearing a daisy.
- **blob** — a sphere pushed to an ellipsoid with FIXED harmonics
  (same seed, same lump). The crown, the mound, the blossom balls.

A part never touches three.js: it names a shape and hands over
numbers, exactly the `gshape.js` contract. SPEC colours are ROLE
names (`ground`, `leaf`, `leafD`, `bloom`, …) resolved once by the
palette, so a green only ever means "the leaf green of this garden".

### The formation

The layout publishes a tiny hierarchy of anchors — the soil surface,
the crown, the leaf unit — and each part roots on the one above it.

| anchor | who owns it | who reads it |
|---|---|---|
| `rootY` — the soil surface | the mound | blades, rosettes, stems root here |
| `crownY` — the top of the stem | the stem | the leaves hang off it; the bloom perches here |
| `leaf.size` | the leaves | the one size every leaf is built from |

That is the muzzle lesson, fourth time: parts never reach into each
other's params, they read the anchor the owner published.

### Determinism

The build may never call the rng. Every count, size, lean and seed is
rolled in `gen()` and the geometry uses a positional hash
(`oshash(seed, i)`) to place a blade among a ring of blades — the
same stable-scatter trick the voxel hand's `h01` does. Same recipe,
same plant, on any machine.

### Species, the gardener's four

`grass` (a tuft, no trunk), `plant` (a rosette on a short stalk),
`tree` (a crown on a mighty trunk), `flower` (a daisy on a thin neck)
— plus `wildcard`, the free roll. Palettes are role-named leaf-beds
(meadow/lime/fern/bloom/desert/tundra) of soil, trunk, leaf and bloom;
the finishes are gared `matte` (dry), `glaze` (rain) and `fuzz`.

### Adding things

- a **shape** = a new case in `SHAPES` in `oshape.js` — a new family
  only with a new kind of outline (a palm, a cactus, a fruit).
- a **variant** = an entry in a part's gen/weighted table plus a
  branch in its `build`. This is the cheap lever.
- a **species** = one entry of weights in `ospecies.js` named after a
  plant.
- a **palette** = one entry in `opalette.js`.
- a **finish** = `FINISHES` in `omedia.js` (remember the weight table
  in the same file, or the reachability check throws).

`__object` exposes `recipe / P / stats / bounds / rebuild / frame /
pump(n) / set(patch) / reroll(id)`. Measure with `pump`, never by
watching a hidden panel.

## 14. The photo (`photo.html`, `src/photo.js`)

A SCENE, not a fifth generator: it grows nothing itself. It deals
recipes to the gloss rig and the plants rig and only decides who
stands where — the two generators still share no runtime with each
other; they share this page the way they share the menu. One seed
composes the whole shot, so a shot number IS the shot, faces and all.

### The composition grammar

Copied from the reference render it chases, and dealt in this order
off the shot's rng:

- **the main line** — one giant dead centre, then mediums down to
  smalls in strictly falling size. The line packer places each sitter
  against the edges the earlier ones actually claimed (using the
  BUILT width, never a plan), centre-out, just past touching; a
  sitter that would leave the frame is pulled back to the boundary
  and pushed FORWARD, so the line folds round its own ends.
- **the tiny front row** — pocket-sized ones loose across the whole
  width. The tiny tier is what makes the giant giant.
- **the garden** — trees are BIG and stand BEHIND the crowd like
  backdrop; grass, flowers and houseplants are small, at the feet,
  filling gaps. One knee-high everything read as a shelf of samples.
  The garden wears dead-matte only; the lab's glaze roll next to the
  characters' pour read as cheap plastic.
- **the weather** — head-only floaters (spheres more often than not:
  a cube floating on nothing is a glitch, a ball is a balloon) in
  CLUSTERS: an anchor with satellites on spread ring angles, anchors
  re-rolled until they clear each other and the pyramid's crown,
  plus a stray tiny one or two. Floaters cast no shadows — theirs
  could only land halfway up the wall, a stain attached to nobody.

### The post stack

The one page with real postprocessing: `vendor/postprocessing/`
(three's EffectComposer chain) plus `vendor/n8ao.js` for SSAO, wired
in `photo.html`'s importmap (`n8ao` also statically imports the
pmndrs `postprocessing` package — `vendor/pp-stub.js` satisfies it).
The set is real geometry — floor running into a back wall, both the
same paint — because an AO pass can only shade what is in the depth
buffer, and a cyc corner disappears when the only thing marking it
is the AO gradient. Two hard-won rules:

- **one gamma conversion, at the end, only.** N8AO gamma-corrects
  its output by default and OutputPass converts to sRGB again; the
  double pass washed the whole photo to chalk. `gammaCorrection:
  false` on the pass, no tone mapping on the renderer.
- **the key stands camera-side.** The labs hang it steeply overhead,
  which pools every shadow UNDER the body — exactly where a level
  camera cannot see it, occluded by the very thing that cast it. The
  photo's key is up front and left, so shadows fall back-right into
  the gaps between sitters, which is where the reference keeps its
  occlusion.

`__photo` exposes `seed / actors / reshoot(seed) / frame / pump(n) /
stats()`. Same recipe in, same photo out — check `stats().xs`.

## 15. Marbles (`marbles.html`, `src/marbles/`)

The third game, and the first one made out of the molded characters.

**THE LOOP.** A tide of small dark things walks down a long sheet of ice
toward a red line. You hold three living marbles. You pull one back and
let go: it slides, it CRUSHES everything small it rolls over, it BOUNCES
off the boards and off the brutes, and wherever it comes to rest it
PLANTS and fights on its own, for ever, like a turret you threw. If it
strikes one of YOUR marbles on the way, that marble fires its one big
move — along the blow — and is sent sliding itself, which can strike a
third. That is the chain, it is the only skill in the game, and
everything else exists to make it legible. Kill enough and you level:
three cards, take one. Let twenty over the line and the run is over.

```
marbles.js   the rules, the run, the hand, the HUD — and nothing else
mtable.js    the sheet: ice, boards, house, camera, world→screen
mfoes.js     the tide — eight kinds, parallel arrays, one grid
mphys.js     momentum, the hook, the chain
mcombat.js   the four verbs an ability is written in
mkinds.js    the roster — stats and drawing, one object
mboost.js    the level-up cards
mfx.js       the juice
msound.js    the toybox
```

### The one idea that makes it possible

**A small enemy is not a physics body.** It is a position, a hit point
count and an instance. It never pushes anything, never resolves a
contact and never asks the solver a question — a marble rolling over it
simply kills it. Only the marbles are dynamic and there are never more
than a couple of dozen, which is why five hundred enemies cost about as
much as an idle contact sheet: 473 of them, 9 marbles, 625 particles
and 238 draw calls measured at **2.9 ms a frame**.

The BRUTE is the exception on purpose — the only enemy a marble bounces
off, so the only one that changes a shot. Brutes are also the only
enemies wearing real molded characters (five rigs, re-worn); everything
else is one `InstancedMesh` per kind with the eyes welded into the body
geometry and the whites baked as vertex colours. That is legal only
because every enemy walks the same way, toward the camera, so a face on
+z always faces the player.

### The sheet is long, and that is the design

Thirty-six units of ice, nine wide. A walker crosses it in the better
part of a minute, which is where the density comes from: at three
spawns a second and a forty-second walk, a hundred and twenty of them
are out there without anything ever arriving in a rush. Speed the tide
up and you have to slow the spawns, and then the ice is empty.

A nearly square table was built first and was wrong for one reason: with
the far end ten units away a thrown marble arrives before its curve has
done anything, and the curve is the game.

The camera frames the NEAR section only (`FIELD.view`) — thirty-six
units in a phone-shaped window puts the near end at the size of a coin.
The rest runs away up the screen and the fog takes the far end before
the geometry runs out, so nothing is cropped and nothing has an edge.

### The hook belongs to the marble

You choose a direction and a force. The CURVE is a property of the
thing in your hand — `curl`, positive breaks right — and a big one is
not a drawback: it is the only way to reach behind a brute.

It is a **turn rate that goes as 1/speed**, which is a constant sideways
acceleration expressed as a rotation. Constant turn rate was the first
attempt and is wrong twice: on a sheet this long a full-power throw is
airborne for four seconds, so any rate big enough to see turned the
shot through a hundred and sixty degrees. Going as 1/v the marble runs
almost true while it is fast and BREAKS at the end — what a curling
stone does, and what makes the shot readable.

Rotate the velocity, never add to it: a shot that gets faster as it
curves reads as a bug even when the numbers are right.

**Every marble can reach the far end** on clear ice at full power, and
that is a floor the roster has to respect: a kind that physically
cannot be thrown the length of the sheet is a kind whose whole far half
of the board is missing. The sheet is 36.5 units from the hand to the
walk-on line and a throw leaves at 26, so `v²/(2·gripBase·friction)`
caps friction at about 1.7 — Boulder was at 2.7 and stopped two thirds
of the way up. What friction still decides is everything BETWEEN: at
half power a Bolt runs three times as far as a Boulder, and a lane full
of bodies takes its cut of both.

**And it SLIDES — it does not roll.** The first build tumbled the
marble end over end at v/r, which is what a ball on grass does and is
not what anything on ice does; it also put the face underground twice a
second, and the faces are the cast. A marble now turns slowly about its
own vertical axis, the way it hooks — which is where the word "curl"
comes from — with a small lean into the travel selling the momentum.
The turn unwinds to face the player as it settles: a stone has no front
and may stop anywhere, but a marble with a face on it has to end up
looking at the thing it is about to fight.

`previewPath` is the same integrator run forward on an empty sheet, so
the dotted line is drawn by the code that will move the marble.

**But it only LEADS.** Drawn all the way to the resting place it
answered the entire question — direction, hook and distance — and a
throw with nothing left to judge is a throw you are executing rather
than making. It stops after about eight units, a fifth of a full-power
shot: enough to aim by, nowhere near enough to plan by, and it fades
out rather than ending so it makes no promise about the spot it stops
at. The reach ring stays home under the marble in your hand for the
same reason.

### The crush is a kill, once per marble per enemy

**If a marble goes over something small, that thing dies** — whatever
its hit points say. The crush was a damage number scaled by momentum,
and in play that meant a slow marble visibly rolled straight over a
walker and the walker got up, which reads as the game refusing a hit
you can see landing. What speed buys is not lethality, it is REACH: a
marble sheds a fraction of its speed for every body it ploughs, so how
deep a lane goes is still decided by how hard you threw.

**The plough is a run of notes, not a stutter.** Each body is a `crush`
and consecutive ones climb a couple of semitones over a full lane, with
a low `mow` swelling under every fourth. Twenty identical squashes in a
second fuse into gravel and the biggest thing a throw does goes unheard
— and the duck table made it worse, fading the sound out exactly as the
plough got good. Measured: silence to −14 dBFS peak while ploughing.

It fires ONCE per marble per enemy. It used to fire once per SUBSTEP,
and the substep count is derived from the frame time — so a 120 Hz
machine dealt 1.6× the damage and 1.6× the plough drag of a 60 Hz one.
The tide carries a `mark` array stamped with the marble's `uid`.

Anything a marble REBOUNDS off is exempt, because that is a bounce and
not a crush: a brute is a wall, and a carapace is a lighter one. The
carapace used to soak 78% of the crush instead, and that was the wrong
shape — the marble ploughed over it and it shrugged. Now the marble
skids off and pays for the line it lost, while the shell takes the
impact. Still the enemy a throw cannot simply answer; it just says so
with the shot instead of with a number.

### They melt, and the clock is not damage

A planted marble has `life` seconds and then it is gone. This is the
single most important rule in the game and it went through two wrong
versions:

- **as a fraction of its own maximum** every marble lived the same
  twenty seconds however tough it was, so hit points meant nothing;
- **as flat damage per second** `+35% hit points` became `+35% marbles
  on the sheet`, and an auto-played run compounded that into forty-seven
  of them standing at once, at which point the tide was annihilated at
  the far hog line and nothing could happen any more.

A clock no booster touches is the only version where the army has a
ceiling. Heavy kinds last longer, and the marble visibly shrinks by
whichever is worse — the clock or the damage — so it needs no bar.

### Five may bite one marble

Without a cap every enemy that touched a marble stopped and stayed: six
hundred of them stacked behind eight marbles at a dead front line, one
life lost in three and a half minutes. A marble was not a turret, it was
a plug. Five can reach it; the rest flow around it and keep walking, so
gaps in the screen leak and the question every throw answers becomes
*what is not covered*.

For the same reason only a **bomber** hunts. Everything else walks at
the line and bites what is in its way on the road.

### The roster contract (`mkinds.js`)

The stats ARE the drawing, third time. A kind does not have a colour
AND a set of stats — it pins a gloss recipe, and the recipe is the
readout: hue says what it does, finish says how far it slides, form says
what it weighs, silhouette says how it fights. Every marble is a
different character of that kind, because only the recipe's identity
fields are pinned and the rest rolls.

Two behaviours and no more:

- **idle** — what it does planted, on a cooldown, for ever;
- **burst** — its one big move. A collision fires BOTH parties' bursts
  (one hit, one chain link, two bursts — "I smash these two together,
  they both do their thing" is the player's model and it wins), along
  the blow `(nx, nz)` with the down-sheet component FLIPPED: there are
  no enemies behind your own line, and a cone firing backwards reads as
  a bug even when the vector is honest. Radial bursts (Frost, Boulder)
  are radial on purpose — the ones you fire with no angle.

`range` is a single number read by the ability itself and by both rings
the game draws with it. It was a label beside a literal buried in
`idle.fire` — the two-parallel-tables pattern, and it had already
drifted by a factor of two. Adding a kind is one entry; a startup check
rejects one missing a burst, an idle, a range, a life or a blurb.

### The tide's contract (`mfoes.js`)

Every kind must be answerable by a DIFFERENT decision — two enemies that
both mean "throw harder" are one enemy with two models. Mote is
material; walker is the baseline; runner reaches the line first; spitter
shoots from outside your range; bomber walks into a marble and takes
half its life; splitter makes three more problems where it dies;
carapace has a shell that only stops the CRUSH, so a throw cannot answer
it; mender undoes everybody's work.

Hit points are deliberately not uniform. A mote is cheap — it is the
material a lane is made of, and a throw that cannot mow one does not
feel like anything. The weight sits on the big ones. Inflating
everything evenly was measured and it killed the plough.

### They arrive in formations

The tide is not a hose. A formation walks on every `gap` seconds — a
SHAPE (`block`, `wedge`, `line`, `files`, `ring`, `arrow`) crossed with
a MARCH (`straight`, `zigzag`, `drift`, `open`) — and between them
there is quiet ice. The quiet is the point: it is the only time the
player gets to look at the board, decide what is uncovered and place a
throw on purpose rather than at whatever is nearest. A continuous
trickle at the same enemies-per-second has no such moment in it, and
the sheet read as one long undifferentiated smear.

A formation stays rigid because its members share a LATERAL rule
(`mvx`, or one zigzag phase) rather than each wandering off its own
seed. Driving the zigzag off each enemy's own z instead of a shared
clock would shear a block into a wave. `open` is the deliberate
exception: there the rule is a function of where the member stands,
which is what makes it open.

The kind is SINGLE per formation. A square of carapaces is a question —
*your throws cannot answer this* — while a square of one of everything
is the average of eight questions, which is no question at all. A
quarter of them carry a few of something tougher tucked inside, which
is how a mender gets to be a thing you have to dig out of a crowd.

### A wave is three or four formations and then a boss

That is the whole run structure, and it repeats with tougher and faster
enemies. Nothing about the tide is keyed to the CLOCK — the units are
the ones the player experiences: "I am on wave five" and "I am level
nine" are things you know, "I am at two minutes forty" is not.

**Toughness is the wave; speed is the LEVEL.** Two clocks, on purpose.
`hp` climbs half a wave's worth each time. Speed runs off `paceOf(lv)`
— 5.5% a level, one multiplier for the whole roster, so a runner is
always about twice a walker. Both used to hang off the wave, and a wave
is three or four levels long: the tide walked at *exactly* the same
speed for minutes at a time, so an escalation that was real on paper
was invisible in the hand. The level is the finer clock, it is already
ticking in the corner of the HUD, and putting speed on it means every
draft visibly costs you something — you come out of it stronger and so
does the sheet.

The trap it sets, and it bit immediately: `setPace`/`setParade` are the
only two calls that push the number into the tide and they lived in
`beginWave` alone. Keyed to the level and applied on the wave, the
value would have been right in `pressure()` and stale everywhere it
mattered. **Anything computed from a clock has to be re-applied on
that clock's tick, not on a different one's** — hence `applyPace()`,
called from both.

### The tempo, and the two invariants that let you turn it

`TEMPO` is one multiplier over every walking speed in the game — the
parade, the brutes, the boss. **Difficulty and TEMPO are not the same
complaint**: difficulty is the refill and the hit points, tempo is how
much happens a second, and "it feels slow" is answered here and
nowhere else. It sits at **1.8**: a walker crosses the sheet in 48
seconds, where at 1 it took 86. The file next door called that "the
better part of a minute" and had been wrong about it for a long time;
1.5 made the sentence true at 57 seconds and still read slow.

Turning it is only safe because two numbers are pinned against it:

**The gap is a DISTANCE, not a duration.** `population = size ×
crossing ÷ gap`, so once the gap is expressed as a span of ice the
SPEED cancels out of that entirely and `ON_ICE` (136) is an invariant
the tempo cannot touch. In seconds the gap was coupled to both ends
and drifted with either — speed the tide up and the same blocks per
minute spread over more ground until the ice went empty; grow `size`
and the count crept up as a side effect of a number that was only ever
about a block's shape.

**`size` escalates a formation's SHAPE, not the count** — a bigger
question arriving less often. Which is what makes "the escalation is
toughness, not count" true by construction rather than by hoping.

Measured across the run, and all three hold at once:

| | w1 lv1 | w3 lv7 | w6 lv15 | w8 lv20 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| parade speed | .76 | 1.01 | 1.34 | 1.55 |
| crossing | 48s | 36s | 27s | 23s |
| block | 6×3 | 7×4 | 8×4 | 8×5 |
| gap | 6.7s | 6.6s | 6.7s | 6.8s |
| rail transit of one block | 3.3s | 3.3s | 2.5s | 2.7s |
| **on the sheet** | **136** | **136** | **136** | **136** |
| boss approach | 21s | 15s | 12s | 10s |

The quiet holds near seven seconds, the blocks get bigger and further
apart, and the sheet's population never moves.

**The ceiling on `TEMPO` is the RAIL, not the tide.** A block may not
arrive faster than the one in front of it can clear the walk-on line,
or the parade silts into a smear at the far end — and that comparison
is the last two rows above: a 6.8-second gap against a 2.7-second
transit at wave eight. There is room above 1.8. (The old "five arrivals
a second" figure was measured from a continuous hose and does not
describe a parade; the transit is the number that does.)

One consequence worth stating: a number tuned at one tempo cannot be
carried over to another. `REFILL` 5.4 was measured against a tide
walking at .42 and read as an infinite hand; 6 against a tide walking
at .76 is a much *shorter* fraction of a crossing than that was.
Re-measure, do not translate.

And turning `TEMPO` up does cost difficulty even though it is not a
difficulty knob — a faster tide is simply harder. Measured on the
auto-player, 1.5 → 1.8 took a run from 4m 56s to 3m 05s. The fix for
that is `REFILL`, not the tempo: at 1.8 with `REFILL` 5 instead of 6 a
run comes back to about 4m 25s with none of the speed given up. That
separation is the whole reason the two knobs are separate.

**It is a PARADE.** One formation shape — an EXACT rectangle of n×m
(the requested size rounds to a full rectangle: a block of fifteen used
to end in a half-row of three, and the eye finds the straggler before
it finds the shape), ranks
wider than files — two marches (straight, one shared zigzag), and ONE
forward speed for every small kind in the wave, set per wave
(`tide.setParade`). Six shapes and four marches were built first and
cut: with mixed per-kind speeds the wave smeared into a crowd inside
twenty seconds as formations caught each other up, and the extra
silhouettes read as disorder, not variety. Uniform speed means the gaps
between blocks HOLD (measured: a 4.4-unit gap unchanged after forty
seconds of walking), uniform gait means everyone bobs to the same beat,
and every status effect — slow, stun, haste — reads against the parade,
which makes each more visible, not less. Variety lives in the kind, the
variant, the size and the march. The big kinds (brute, boss) are exempt
and lumber on their own clock; the swift/heavy variants no longer touch
speed, only size and toughness.

A wave is FIVE to SEVEN formations, about eleven seconds apart — the
gap is what the player has to look at the board with, and it is the
scarcest thing in the game. The LAST formation of a wave is the wave's
THEME — one kind, in bulk,
with a name on it, drawn only from kinds the run has already met — so a
wave ends on its hardest question and then on its boss.

The BOSS closes it: a `boss` enemy wearing its own molded body (crazed
ceramic over a bruised violet, and the rig is rolled until the cast
gives it HORNS — at forty pixels the silhouette is all that survives,
and a hornless boss reads as "large" rather than as "dangerous"). Its
movement is ROLLED, not chosen from a shelf: a pattern, an amplitude, a
phase and a direction, so the boss on wave four does not move like the
one on wave three. Formations keep arriving while it is up, thinner —
a boss alone on empty ice is a damage race with no board in it. The
wave ends when it dies.

It is the only health bar in the game. Everything else on the ice dies
too fast to have a state worth showing.

**A boss is a WALL, and that took a fix worth recording.** `bounceOf`
tested `=== BRUTE_IX`; the boss sits at `BRUTE_IX + 1`, so it fell
straight through to the crush path and died to a single marble rolling
over it — a wave's whole closing act, answered by throwing anything at
it once. The moment there was a second big kind, every `===` against
the first one became a latent bug.

The second half of the same bug was `MAX_FOE_R`, the slop every grid
query adds. It was typed as .95 — the brute's radius — and the boss
arrived at 1.5, *bigger than the margin meant to cover it*, so the
sweep could not see a boss until the marble was already most of the way
inside it. It is derived from the table now: a constant that means "the
biggest one" must be computed, or the next kind bigger than it silently
breaks every query in the game. Measured after both: a marble stops
dead at the contact distance and rebounds at about 72% of its speed.

### A clash is worth about a quarter of a big one

The FIRST boss (1040 hp — `800 × pressure(1).hp`) goes down in **four
full-power rams** to any of the four kinds the bag starts with, three
to a Spike. That is the number the ram constant is set from, and it is
a real cost at a 9-second refill: four clashes is your whole hand and
one more. Measured down a clear lane from the hand:

| | Popper | Ember | Frost | Spike | Bolt | Goo | Boulder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| % of the first boss | 32 | 30 | 26 | 44 | 24 | 19 | 69 |
| clashes | **4** | **4** | **4** | 3 | 5 | 6 | 2 |

Bolt, Goo and Boulder are the tier-2 unlocks — you only meet the first
boss with the other four. A brute (975) is the same rule, 3–4.

**`mass` was in that damage line and it was the same fact twice.**
Every kind is authored at `impact ≈ 1.4 × mass`, so `impact * mass`
SQUARED the weight axis and the Goo-to-Boulder spread came out 11.5×.
That is why this document used to claim ~12% and 2.3% per ram in two
different paragraphs and *both were honest measurements* — of different
ends of a spread nobody meant to be that wide. Damage is `impact` alone
now, a 3.8× spread, the one `impact` was written to have. Weight still
does its job in the rebound and in the clack that shoves your own
marble, which is what the `denser` card was always really buying.

Speed is linear in that line, so a ram through traffic is worth
proportionally less than one down a clear lane — measured at about 70%
when the marble ploughs a formation on the way in. That is the trade
and it is the right one: the clash you set up beats the clash you
happened to make.

**The escalation is toughness, not count.** The sheet is nine units
wide and a walker covers less than half a unit a second, so it can
physically carry about five arrivals a second before the walk-on line
jams: measured at three and a half a second, the whole tide silted into
one solid mass at the far end and the rest of the ice was empty. The
count therefore tops out around two a second — still a hundred and
seventy on the ice at once — and everything after that is hit points.

### Balance was measured, not guessed

`__marbles` exposes `frame / pump / headless(on) / place / throwFrom /
stats / dps(kind)`. `headless(true)` skips every part of the frame that
only exists on a screen, so a naive auto-played run — throw whenever a
slot is ready, aim down a random lane — costs about 0.4 ms a frame and
four minutes of game time runs in seconds. The roster's damage numbers
were set that way: measured against a dense field, the spread was 19 to
201 damage a second before it was 68 to 175.

Three things that only a measured run would have found, all recorded in
the code: the melt clock shadowed by a `life: null` placeholder later in
the same object literal (every marble melted on its first planted
frame — the `exp`/`n` collision again); `table.place()` moved after
`fx.update`, which silently discarded every camera shake in the game;
and `deep cold` stacking past 1.0, at which point `mul = 1 - slowK` went
negative and the tide walked backwards up the sheet.

### Enemies cannot touch a marble

A marble has TIME on the ice and nothing else. The tide gives marbles
a visible berth — a pre-emptive swerve plus the hard walk-around push —
and keeps walking at the line; marble hit points do not exist any more.
The history is worth one line each: stop-and-chew made marbles plugs, a
chew cap made queues, bite-in-passing made hit points matter again and
split the player's attention across two clocks. One resource, one
clock.

The only enemies that interact with a marble at all are the THIEVES: a
spitter's bolt steals 2 seconds, a bomber's blast up to 5 — the same
currency the cards buy. Time is a STAT now (`mods.time`, `mods.
timeFlat`, and the gilded `last word`, which fires a melting marble's
burst as it goes — measured taking fourteen walkers with it).

The BOSS steers AROUND planted marbles — it reads the ice ahead and
walks the gap, so the fight is herding: where it goes is decided by
where you have NOT planted.

### The boss walks on with the parade

It enters at `FIELD.far`, the same walk-on line as every formation, at
the same moment the wave's THEME formation does, and it comes down the
sheet at the **parade's own speed** — dropping to its lumber only once
it is in frame. It arrives with its own last block, which is what
"follows the parade" means literally.

It used to spawn at `FIELD.far + 6` — six units *inside* the line, the
only thing in the game that entered anywhere else — and then hustle at
2.8×, which is 2.3× the parade. So it overtook the procession it exists
to close, and crossed the most foreshortened band on the screen (z −30
to −14.5 is 14% of the screen's height) in nine seconds. That reads as
APPEARING rather than arriving, which is the one thing this game
promises never to do — and the comment above it claimed it came "from
the fog like everything else" the whole time.

The forty-second commute that drove it inside is paid for by moving the
SPAWN earlier rather than the speed higher: the approach is spent
fighting the block it walked on with. Measured: **37.4 seconds** from
the rail to the frame at wave-one pace, all of it visible.

Three things follow from it, and each was a bug first:

- **The banner is the SIGHTING, not the spawn.** It fires when the boss
  crosses `FIELD.view`. Fired at spawn it announced a thing nobody
  could see for half a minute. The name and health bar are on the HUD
  from the spawn, so the approach is not a secret — it is a countdown.
- **The lull ends on the sighting, not on a clock.** Nothing new walks
  on while the boss is coming: the player has the theme formation to
  grind and a shape in the haze to read the board against. Left on its
  old timer the thin formations started a full half-minute before the
  boss arrived and quietly added two blocks to every wave — an
  escalation nobody asked for, hidden inside a change about where the
  boss walks on. Measured, that alone cost a seed 160 seconds of run.
- **The boss's death is checked in every stage.** It used to be tested
  only inside the boss branch, which was safe exactly as long as a boss
  could not exist before that branch owned it. It can now, and a boss
  killed on the approach left the lull waiting for a sighting that was
  never coming.

**Nothing is ever born on camera.** A formation is shifted so its
leading edge sits at the walk-on line, the seeder never pushes past
`FIELD.view`, and the boss comes out of the fog like the rest.
Measured: zero non-mote spawns inside the frame over a sixty-second
run. (A brood's motes are the exception by design — it is visibly
laying them.)

Every kind's idle must be something you can POINT AT. Frost was the
lesson: it chilled by query, mechanically perfect and visually nothing
— it now lays a visible frost pool and the pool does the chilling.
Ten swarm kinds now: `brood` lays motes as it walks (kill it early or
meet everything it laid), `herald` is the drum — everything near it
walks half again as fast; the inverse of the mender, stealing time
instead of undoing damage.

**The reaper runs LAST, and the dead are never dressed.** The stray
grey dashes a playtest screenshot caught were orphaned time bars: the
melt loop ran after `reapMarbles`, so a marble that melted was still in
the array when `dressMarbles` ran that same frame — and `barFor`
quietly rebuilt a bar for the corpse, which the next frame's reap
orphaned on the ice for ever. Two fixes, both kept: the reaper moved
after the melt loop, and dressing skips `!m.alive` regardless. A
lazily-created presentation object plus a "dead but still in the array"
window is a resurrection bug by construction.

A formation is ONE kind, no exceptions — a quarter used to carry a few
"guests" of something tougher, and it blurred the read: a formation is
a question, and a question with a footnote is two questions badly
asked. There is no opening seed either: the run begins on empty ice and
the first formation walks out of the fog like every other — the empty
opening is the tutorial. Twelve clear seconds separate a dead boss from
the next wave's first formation, which is the only time deliberate play
happens. And the camera raked up from 44–30° to 55–42°: at the old
angle everything drawn flat on the ice — bars, pools, the saw — was
seen nearly edge-on and collapsed to a sliver.

The MELT is legible: a marble on its way out shrinks to 40%, wobbles,
vents frost and ticks like a kettle for its last three seconds. The
shrink used to stop at 62% and then the marble vanished in a puff —
the single most-reported confusion in playtesting ("balls just
disappear").

### A level-up is only ever an improvement; a BOSS pays in marbles

Every card in `BOOSTERS` makes a number you already have bigger. The
three `unlock:` cards are not in that table any more — they are
`RECRUITS`, and they are dealt by killing a boss.

A new marble is a different kind of decision from "+5% damage": it
changes what is IN your hand rather than what your hand does. Dealt
into the same three-card draft it had to compete with an improvement on
a level-up that had nothing to do with it, and worse, it was a GAMBLE —
a run could reach its end without ever being offered Boulder. Now:
kill a boss, take a marble. Three bosses, three marbles, and the roster
is complete by the fourth wave whatever the dice say, so the unlock
stops being luck and becomes the reward for the one fight the game
builds up to. Verified: 27,000 level-up cards dealt across levels 1–30,
zero unlocks among them.

All the remaining locked kinds are offered, so it is 3 → 2 → and then
the last one **is not a draft at all**: a modal with a single button on
it is a pause with a button on it, so the final marble simply arrives
with its name over the ice, like every other announcement in the game.

They keep their `unlock:` ids, because `needs:` still reads them out of
`taken` and `takeBooster` still applies them — this is a different
DEAL, not a different kind of card. What `showDraft` had to learn is
that a recruit's SUBJECT is `unlock`, not `kind`: with no `kind` it
rendered "everyone · BOLT joins" and no portrait, on the one card in
the game that is entirely about which marble you are looking at. The
display reads `b.kind ?? b.unlock`; the apply path still does not, and
must not.

### A card has a target

`mods` split in two. Global mods keep what has no owner — the hand, the
recharge, the throw arm, the chain, the line. Everything else lives in
`W.kmods[kind]`, one object per marble type, and a `scope: 'kind'` card
is dealt WITH a target attached: "+25% damage — EMBER" touches every
Ember on the ice and nothing else. An ability reads its OWNER's mods
(`m.mods`, the kind's object by reference), never a global — which is
also what makes a card taken mid-run reach every standing marble of its
type for free. The card's takenKey tracks the (card, kind) pair, so
sharpening your Embers does not step down the odds of sharpening your
Frosts. The aim preview integrates with the kind's own mods too: a
polished Bolt and a stock Bolt draw different lines.

The crush card had died silently when the crush became a kill — "+30%
crush damage" multiplied a number nobody read any more. It came back as
`plow`: speed KEPT per body ploughed, which is reach through a crowd —
the only thing left for a crush card to buy.

### One recharge clock

Three empty slots used to refill in parallel, so dumping the whole hand
cost the same recovery as spending one marble — and the recharge is the
throw's only price, so a price that does not stack is not a price.
`S.refillT` is THE clock: marbles come back one at a time, the progress
bar shows on the next slot in line, and the rest wait their turn empty.

**The run opens on a FULL HAND and a LONG clock** — three marbles
standing at frame one, `REFILL` at 7.5 seconds. It was one marble at
5.4 for a while, on the argument that the first thing the game teaches
should be the thing it charges for all run; what it actually taught was
that the opening is a wait, with empty ice, nothing to decide and two
slots ticking. The refill teaches itself the moment you spend, so the
stock goes up front and the price goes up behind it. Measured over
three seeds of a max-rate auto-player (throw the instant a slot is
ready, aim down a random lane):

| | 1 marble · 5.4 | 3 marbles · 9 | · 7.5 | · 6, tempo 1.5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| run length | 8m 08s | 6m 24s | 7m 18s | 4m 56s |
| first life lost | 2m 32s | 3m 14s | 3m 35s | 2m 30s |
| throws | 92 | 47 | 64 | 52 |
| marbles standing | 3.2 | 2.3 | 2.8 | 3.3 |

(The last column is not comparable to the others as a difficulty
reading — the tide walks 50% faster in it. It is here because the
refill and the tempo have to be read together.)

The shape is the point, not the totals: the opening got *safer* and the
back half got shorter — first blood moved later while the run moved
earlier, so a run now holds and then breaks instead of leaking steadily
from two minutes in. The standing army follows straight from the two
clocks, `life / REFILL` × nothing else: about 22 seconds of melt over a
7.5-second refill is 2.9 marbles, and it measured 2.8.

**IT IS THE MOST SENSITIVE NUMBER IN THE GAME, so move it in small
steps and measure both ends.** 9 → 7.5 is a 17% shorter clock and it
bought back 24% of the run length — a full minute and a half. The first
difficulty knob to turn is also the easiest one to turn too far, in
either direction: 5.4 was an infinite hand, 9 was a wait.

And `REFILL` is a STARTING number, not a fixed one. `quick hands` is a
plain card at `w: 14`, so a run that wants its hand back buys it back —
the three runs above averaged 6.8 seconds a throw against a nominal 7.5.

### The cascade

Every link of a chain is louder, slower and bigger than the last, and
each of those is small on its own:

- **bullet time** — `S.chainSlow`, separate from the two-frame
  `hitstop`, deepens with the chain so a five-marble cascade plays at a
  third speed and you get to WATCH it instead of hearing that it
  happened. It decays in REAL time, not in the dilated time it is
  creating, or a deep chain would take most of a minute to come back;
- an ascending chime up the pentatonic — a chain is a PHRASE, in the
  key the whole game is written in;
- a shockwave sized by depth, growing shake, and a counter over the
  middle of the sheet rather than down by the player's thumb, which is
  a counter nobody reads during a cascade;
- from the third link a blast at the struck marble and a drum hit under
  the chime; from the fifth a nova and the red line itself flashes gold;
- a burst's AREA grows with the chain (`bloom` in mkinds.js, up to
  double) — the damage multiplier alone was invisible: a ×4 chain dealt
  four times the number and looked exactly like a ×1;
- and a PAYOFF when the ice goes quiet: the whole chain scored in one
  lump, with the level-up fanfare from ×4 up. Scored silently, a point
  at a time while the screen is shaking, a cascade never lands as an
  achievement.

### The score

`msound.js` is the toybox — every effect is a sound a plastic toy could
make — but the MUSIC is a score rather than furniture. The first version
was three quiet layers built to be ignorable (a pad, a sparse pluck, a
heartbeat), which is right for a game about a pencil and wrong for a
sheet of ice with a tide walking down it.

It is generative, in D minor at 84 BPM — the relative minor of the F
major pentatonic every pitched effect is written in, so the score and
the sound effects share seven notes and cannot clash. Eight bars, four
chords (i–VI–III–VII; the boss swaps in iv and a major V, and that
raised seventh is the entire reason the harmonic minor sounds like
something is coming). Layers enter with intensity: a gliding string pad
(it retunes rather than retriggering — restarting eight oscillators
every two bars reads as a synth patch changing, not as strings moving),
an octave bass, a sixteenth OSTINATO which is the engine of the thing,
drums from about a third of the way up, and a brass motif rationed to
high intensity or a boss so it stays an event.

**It never goes silent.** `over` is a musical STATE, not a stop: it
used to fade the bed out and leave the game-over screen in dead air,
which is the one moment the player is sitting still reading a number
and the worst possible moment for the room to go quiet. The score just
loses everything that was driving it — no drums, no ostinato, no brass,
the filter shut to a murmur — and the harmony keeps turning over with
one low note every other bar. The only thing that may leave the game
silent is a tab nobody is looking at.

Measured on the music bus: peak −12 dBFS with no clipping, and average
level rising monotonically with intensity (0.006 → 0.015 → 0.0165 RMS
from calm to boss). The one number to turn if it fights the game is
`musicBus.gain`.

### The look

Ice is not white. Painted at the value it "should" be, the whole sheet
blew out and took the effects with it — an additive explosion over white
is a slightly brighter white. It sits about two thirds up the range,
with sweep streaks and a pebble normal map, the house at the far end and
the boards down both sides. Every effect that lands on it is smaller,
dimmer and shorter than it wants to be for the same reason.

One bug worth keeping: the title veil is a SIBLING of the stage, not a
child of it, so a tap on "TAP TO PLAY" landed on the veil and the
stage's own listener never heard about it — the button did nothing.
Every automated test missed it, because they all dispatched pointer
events straight at the stage instead of letting the browser hit-test
them. If a test bypasses the DOM, it is not testing the thing the
player touches.

`?shot=N` auto-plays N seconds synchronously at load, for the headless
screenshot that makes the menu thumbnail. The command is in `marbles.js`.

## 16. The second hand (`crowdbrush.html`, `src/brush/`)

A HAND is the thing that makes the marks. `src/sketch.js` is drawai's
own — wobbling ribbon strokes, dry granulation, wrist overshoots,
fills that are techniques. `src/brush/` is a SECOND one, built on
[p5.brush](https://github.com/acamposuribe/p5.brush) (`vendor/brush.esm.js`,
the standalone build: no p5.js, WebGL2, MIT, 77KB), and `crowdbrush.html`
is the crowd drawn with it.

It is a parallel hand, not a replacement, the same way `carve.js`,
`gshape.js` and `oshape.js` are parallel generators. The drawn pages
are untouched and the parts do not know it exists.

### What it plugs into

Nothing in `src/parts/` changed, and nothing needed to. Parts describe
marks — they call `F.media.tone / skin / edge`, which call `s.stroke`,
`s.hatchFill`, `s.washFill` — so replacing the object behind `s`
replaces every mark on the page. `part.js` gained one lever:

```js
setHand(fn)   // fn(w, h) -> a sketch; default is `new Sketch(w, h)`
hand(w, h)    // ask for one, for a scene that draws its own bits
```

`BSketch` **extends `Sketch`**, and that is the whole trick:

- the RNG, the path helpers (`blobPts`, `wobbly`, `poly`) and the
  colour helpers are inherited, so a seed picks the same GEOMETRY in
  both hands. `crowd.html?seed=7` and `crowdbrush.html?seed=7` are the
  same thirty-five people drawn twice;
- only the MARK-MAKERS are overridden. Anything not overridden still
  works, so the port can never be half-broken, only half-done;
- `this.ctx` stays a real 2D context. Parts reach into it 53 times —
  clips, transforms, flat fills — and every one of those still works.

`inkFill` and `paperFill` are deliberately NOT overridden: they are
flat value laid under the drawing, a part calls them a dozen times,
and a brush fill each would be the most expensive thing on the page
for no visible difference.

### The plate

p5.brush draws into the canvas it was loaded onto. Parts need their
own transparent canvas each, so there is ONE plate — a single WebGL
canvas — that every `BSketch` borrows: draw a mark, composite it,
blit it onto the part's own 2D canvas, hand the plate back.

Four things about that, each one bought with a bug:

1. **One canvas, ever.** `brush.load()` on a second canvas leaves
   p5.brush holding framebuffers from the first, and every flush after
   that logs `INVALID_OPERATION: bindFramebuffer`. The plate is
   RESIZED (same element, same context) to fit each part instead —
   exactly, not rounded up, because a composite covers the whole plate
   and every spare pixel is paid for. A resize is 1.7ms and the two
   boil frames of a part share a size, so it happens about once a part.

2. **Marks are drawn under the 2D context's transform.** `rig.js`
   translates the canvas so parts can draw in character coordinates,
   and parts add their own translate/rotate/scale on top. p5.brush
   knows nothing about that context, so `bplate.begin()` decomposes
   `ctx.getTransform()` into brush's own translate/rotate/scale, and
   the blit back runs at identity. Skip this and a part drawing at
   x = -60 puts its mark off the left of the plate: most of every
   character is simply not there, and what survives sits at the wrong
   offset. It looked like one arc of a head's outline and nothing else.

3. **One mark at a time.** p5.brush composites a mark by blending its
   mask over the whole dirty region, and on a TRANSPARENT plate the
   pixels where the new mask is empty come out transparent instead of
   keeping what was under them — so a second mark erases the first. On
   the library's own opaque canvas this never shows. Every mark is
   therefore composited and blitted immediately (~0.8ms), which is
   most of why this hand costs what it does.

4. **Clear to transparent BLACK.** `brush.clear()` clears to rgb(1,1,1)
   with alpha 0, and blitting a premultiplied WebGL canvas in that
   state replaces the destination's colour with white while leaving
   its alpha alone. Every paper-filled shape a part had already laid
   down came out a solid white block. `bplate.wipe()` clears the GL
   buffer again afterwards.

Ordering between the two halves is kept by a Proxy on `ctx`: any 2D
call that draws or moves the frame flushes the plate first. Path
building (`beginPath`/`lineTo`/…) does not, so a `poly(); fill()` pair
is one flush, not six.

### What it can and cannot do

Every route p5.brush offers composites correctly on a transparent
plate — brush tips of all three types (`default`, `marker`, `spray`),
`hatch()` and `mass()` — with ONE exception:

**`brush.fill()` cannot be used.** The watercolour fill — bleed, tide
line and granulation out of one call, the library's headline feature —
blends pigment into the canvas assuming paper underneath. On a
transparent plate it writes an opaque near-white patch: 3077 white
pixels inside a shape that should have been a translucent wash. It
also costs a flat ~18ms whatever the shape's size, and a face asks for
twenty-six of them, so it was never affordable either. A pool is
therefore PAINTED (`BSketch.pour`): crossing passes of the wet tip
inside the shape, then the tide line as a stroke, which is the mark
the eye actually reads as watercolour.

### The tips

Six of drawai's own, in `bplate.js`, registered through `brush.add()`.
Two rules:

- **Flat pressure envelopes.** Pressure in p5.brush MULTIPLIES the
  tip's size. A tip that also tapers itself multiplies twice: a stroke
  authored to thin to .35 at the ends came out at .12 of its width and
  the whole crowd drew as faint outlines. The taper belongs to the
  caller — that is where a part says what kind of mark it wants — and
  it lives in a narrow band (.5 to 1.15), because below about .5 a
  stroke stops reading as a mark at all.
- **Alpha is a property of the TIP**, not of the colour, so it is
  asked for in six buckets and each bucket is a registered brush. Six
  steps is under the eye's resolution for a pencil line and keeps the
  registry to a few dozen entries instead of one per stroke.

`spacing` is the cost knob for every stroke on the page — how often
the tip stamps. It is also the continuity knob, and the two fight:
.85 draws a stroke in half the time of .4 and reads as dots at part
scale. The tips sit at .55–.65 with high `grain` (smoother) and low
`scatter`, which is what stopped the contours coming out speckled.

### What it costs

A character costs **292ms against the graphite hand's 32ms — 9.1×** —
measured the only way that means anything, `buildCharacter` over all
six media × four species in the same page, both hands back to back.
It is flat across the media (graphite 267, ink 278, watercolour 239,
oil 384, chalk 263, marker 214 for a human), because the cost is not
the medium: it is the per-mark composite, and a character makes about
200 marks, each one a render, a blit and a clear.

Do not read the page-fill time off a hidden browser panel. Measured
there the brush crowd fills in 30s and the GRAPHITE one in 22s, which
says almost nothing about either hand — whatever the panel throttles
swamps a 9× difference in drawing. The crowd fills one character per
frame either way, so the honest statement is that this page fills
about nine times slower than the drawn one, progressively, and reads
as slow rather than frozen.

`?u=` and `?frames=` are on both crowd pages now (the defaults are
still 118 and 2), so the resolution and the boil can be turned up for
a still or down for speed. `?hand=graphite` puts the original hand
back on the brush page, for an A/B without changing anything else.

## 17. The styles (`styles.html`, `timeline.html`, `src/styles/`)

Nine ways of PAINTING, on top of the six materials: gothic 1310,
renaissance 1500, baroque 1620, ukiyo-e 1830, impressionism 1874,
expressionism 1910, cubism 1911, dada 1918, surrealism 1929.

### What a style may do that a material may not

A material answers three questions about a SHAPE. A style answers the
same three and then four more about the PICTURE, and it needs to,
because only about half of these movements are defined by their marks.
An outside critic put the limit exactly:

> "It mostly reads as one palette + one texture per row rather than
> nine distinct visual languages… your system nails movements defined
> by MARK and SURFACE (expressionism, dada, baroque, ukiyo-e) and
> struggles with movements defined by FORM (cubism) or MEANING
> (surrealism, gothic's symbolic gold space)."

So there are four optional fields, all one line to adopt, and each of
them buys back one of those movements:

| | what it is | who needed it |
|---|---|---|
| `ink` | the character's BLACK — every `inkA()` a part reaches for | impressionism, which banned lamp black |
| `ground` | the paper the style is painted on | all nine; it is the fastest discriminator there is |
| `backdrop(s, o)` | the SPACE the figure stands in | gothic's gold, baroque's void, surrealism's gag |
| `panel` | the shape of that space | a gothic arch is tall, a surrealist window is wide |

**`ink: [r,g,b]`** reaches the void eyes, the pupils, the contours, the
nostrils and the teeth through one line in `rig.js`, and no part
learns about it — `Sketch` grew a `baseInk` under its `ink` so a part
can still say `setInk(col) … setInk(null)` and get the style's black
back rather than the project's. That is the answer to "let the style
change the eyes": an impressionist void eye is deep violet, gothic's
is iron gall, ukiyo-e's is warm sumi, and expressionism's is the
blackest thing on the page.

**`backdrop(s, { w, h, seed, floor })`** hands the style a transparent
panel behind the figure and lets it paint whatever it likes: a gilded
polyptych compartment with a pointed arch, a void that falls off to
black at the corners, a Magritte sky with a hard cast shadow going the
wrong way, a red hanko seal, a column of newsprint, the same head seen
from a second angle. `floor` is where the figure's feet are, so a
backdrop can put a horizon behind them without knowing anything about
the page. It is drawn ONCE per character rather than per boil frame —
which is exactly why the SEMANTIC things belong there and can never
strobe.

The page owns how big a panel may be and the style owns its shape:
`makeBackdrop` scales the whole thing to the room available, because
an arch that asked for 1.12 cells grew up into the row above it.

And the rule that keeps this from becoming wallpaper, which is the
same critic's:

> **The squint test.** If a row only differs from its neighbours when
> blurred by what is behind it, the style transform is not carrying
> enough. The backdrop is the second half of the argument, never the
> whole of it.

### A style is a medium that is allowed to overrule the palette

`MEDIA` holds two families behind one interface (`tone / skin / edge`,
§4). They are not the same kind of thing:

- a **MATERIAL** (`src/media.js`) is what the drawing is MADE of —
  graphite, ink, oil. It answers the character's colours; it never
  argues with them.
- a **STYLE** (`src/styles/`) is a whole way of painting, and it
  overrules the palette as a matter of course, because a gothic panel
  has five pigments in it and no others. `pigment.js` is the bench
  that makes that cheap: `nearest(col, BOX)` answers the character's
  colour out of the style's own box, `step(col, RAMP)` keeps its VALUE
  when the hue goes, and `spin` / `opposite` / `sat` are there for the
  styles that reason in complements.

The split matters at the page level, not just in the file tree:
`MEDIA_IDS` is the six materials and is still what a page dealing
`'all'` deals, so the house look does not drift. `STYLE_IDS` is the
nine, dealt by `?media=styles`. Both crowds list all fifteen, and the
editor picked them up without being told.

Adding one = a file in `src/styles/` + a line in its `index.js`.
Nothing else in the project needs to know.

### Both hands, and where the line between them falls

A style is written once, in the shared vocabulary, and BOTH hands draw
it — the graphite engine and the p5.brush one (§16). That is most of
the value: nine styles × two hands is eighteen looks out of nine
files. It also imposes the one rule that is easy to get wrong:

> **Micro-texture through `s.ctx`; expressive marks through the hand.**

A crack in a panel, a halftone dot, a plank of wood grain is a
hairline whatever is holding the pen — put it through `s.sline` and
p5.brush hands back a 2px textured brush stroke, and gothic comes back
from the shot looking like a shattered windscreen. A contour, a
tratteggio comb, a comma of broken colour IS a mark someone made, and
each hand should say it its own way. Getting the split wrong is the
single most common way a style looks right in one hand and broken in
the other.

### The two things a still cannot show

Both are on `window.__styles`, and both were written because something
got past a screenshot.

**`audit()`** — builds every style against every species and times it.
A style is handed whatever outline a part happens to have, and some
are degenerate: a two-point sliver, a zero-area shape, a horn six
pixels across. A style that throws on one of those takes the whole
character down, which is worse than looking wrong — nothing downstream
renders at all. (It caught exactly that, twice.)

**`flicker(style)`** — the composition rule:

> **A style may not ROLL a decision that changes the composition.**

Every part is redrawn once per BOIL FRAME with a different seed. A
halo, a sky, a torn patch or a facet cut decided by `s.chance()` is
re-decided two or three times a second, and the character strobes.
Texture may roll — that is the boil, and it is the house style — but
structure may not. Anything a style wants to decide per character has
to key off something STABLE: the shape's size against its plate, its
proportions, a positional hash. (Gothic's halo is a size test against
`s.w` for exactly this reason: haloed characters stay haloed.)

Measuring it: draw both boil frames of every part, average each down
to a 16×16 grid, compare. The boil moves a couple of percent — the
materials sit at 0.022 — and a structural flicker reads several times
that.

### The two pages

`styles.html` is the CONTACT SHEET: one row per style in era order,
the same five people down every column, so the paint is the only
variable. It is the page the styles were judged on, and it takes
`?style=` for one row large, `?hand=graphite`, `?seed=`, `?n=` and
`?shot` for a headless still.

`timeline.html` is the same nine on a DATED LINE, and the axis is
honest — linear in years, nothing compressed. That is the whole point:
the page is mostly empty, and the emptiness is the content. There are
190 years of nothing between the gothic panel and Leonardo and 210
more between Caravaggio and Hokusai; then impressionism, Die Brücke,
cubism, Dada and surrealism arrive inside fifty-five years and pile
into each other. A log axis, or one movement per column, would throw
that away.

The pile-up is handled the way a museum wall handles it: a cluster
that would overlap its neighbour is lifted onto a higher SHELF with a
plumb line down to its own year — shelves being the project's existing
furniture, since every crowd row already stands on one. Greedy packing
puts everything before 1874 on the ground floor and stacks the
twentieth century five high, which is not a decision, it is the data.

The camera FOLLOWS that staircase: it sits down on the single shelf in
1310 and lifts and pulls back as you walk into the 1900s. Framing the
full height everywhere instead spends most of the page on six hundred
years of empty air.

Two things `addPaper` had to learn for it, and they are general: a
page thirty units long needs its grain to REPEAT rather than stretch
(otherwise the paper's tooth blows up into visible blobs), and it must
not repeat the creases or the signature with it — the artist signing
the page nine times is worse than a plain sheet.
